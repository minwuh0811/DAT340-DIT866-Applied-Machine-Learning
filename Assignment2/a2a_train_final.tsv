Now the EU has decided they're happy for Britain to leave as long as they can keep our cash, use us as a military base for a 10-nation "coalition of the willing", and hand down rules forever unchallenged by any form of British input in the workings failings of the EU. Britain was a major pillar of the EU and is still a central player in Europe and the world. What bothers me more is in March 2019 Britain is set to leave and the deal worked for Britain does not serve Britain but Brussels. I can't begin to describe the bloodbath we the British public are going to inflict upon our politicians at the next General Election if they sell us short with a BRslavery. Britain will be a minor-coalition of parties and independents for the next 30 years while Britain is rebuilt. Red and Blue who played their part in this deliberate betrayal will be utterly obliterated and forever regarded as traitors. If May can't cut it get the 42 letters in RIGHT NOW!

0/0/0	"approximately 80% of Britain’s businesses don’t trade with EU member countries but only within the UK or with none-EU member countries" That is not quite the whole story. Virtually all major businesses trade directly with the EU. All the companies in their supply chains trade indirectly with the EU. In those supply chains there will be tens of thousands of small companies that technically only trade with a domestic firm, but in reality they will still have to conform to the same requirements as the larger firm. There is almost no company that doesn’t depend on EU trade, either directly, indirectly through B2B trade or indirectly through consumers whose jobs depend on EU trade. Virtually no SME expects lighter regulations. If there was a list of the regulations that would be changed, we would know by now, but there isn’t. The problem is that the regulations that could be changed are not significant, as virtually all significant regulations are actually quite popular. The harsh truth is that - with the exception of the financial sector - the UK government has virtually always chosen to regulate harder and stricter than any other EU member state. This was never required by the EU. Without the EU, it’s quite possible that regulations will just be easier to pass or change. The facts are not balanced. Brexit has no upside overall, and the sectors that will profit (and there must be some) are hard to predict. We don’t know what the UK economy’s comparative advantage will be, a few years after brexit. No one does.

Not being able to vote for our law makers or President of 500 million people says it all really. 3) I live in France and still voted out because I put principle before ease of life. My girlfriend of 5 years is French and she understood my reason for OUT. 4) Europeans aren't all pro-EU, infact they are people just like us. They also signed up for a trade agreement that was highjacked into a political union nobody in Europe asked for. 5) It's an out dated concept created in the times of the Cold War and Soviet Union. 6) EU is a political institution & is completely separate from Europe as a whole. 7) You cannot create security & provide free Healthcare with unlimited immigration. 8) Turkey is going to join the EU if it's still around in several years. The country that has protected, supplied & supported Jihadists in Syria. It also brought us closer to WW3 with no thought towards other NATO members. 9) The UK would have had to adapt to the Euro if we remained in, removing our ability to manage our own currency. No inflation of deflation means no control of your economy. When it goes wrong look at Greece & Spain. 10) TTIP, the EU is in the process of opening our doors to US corporations, ones like Kaiser medical if you know where I'm going with this? All Leave campaigners aren't misinformed, jobless, racist, xenophobic, bigoted mongos like some of the Remain camp are singing right now.

0/0	A November report by the CBI showed that EU membership was worth up to £3,000 to each household.
1/1	A Remain vote represents Britain's apocalypse - the country will be irrevocably changed by mass immigration and by conspiracies based in Brussels to create an EU superstate, of which Britain will be merely a disempowered province. We want our law making back, our courts to be the final arbiter of life in Britain and robust border controls reinstated to allow us to manage our resources for the benefit of our own people. Only the super rich, the political establishment and the Big Banks want us to remain in - and their profits are their sole motivation. They care nothing for the quality of life here, or the countryside, both of which will be damaged by further waves of mass immigration. We have just one chance to grab the keys to our prison cell and make a dash for freedom on June 23rd. Let's not blow it. Vote Leave.

1/1	A good night had by all at the Brexit Celebration last night in Parliament Square!
0/1	A good video, with some real people, not the fake lying scumbags we normally see referring to Brexit. Yes people would vote to leave if there was another vote offering leave as an option, which is why the remainers dont want leave as an option on a ballot of a 2nd vote. And its very true how can leaving the EU make the poor even poorer when they already have virtually nothing, as the man said he is left with just £10 a month to live on, so they dont care about all the lies/fear spreading, because in truth if it does go bad if we end up with a no deal exist that is down to the MPs for not preparing for a no deal exist, which was always a possibility, like they never prepared for a leave result, you cant blame the leave voters for any of that.

1/-1/0	A no deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain.
0/0	A no deal has always been planned am sure the voters must have known that when they voted for Boris. When prices rise and there are product shortages I am sure the leave voters will be saying it wasn’t me who voted leave.
1/1	A no deal is a very good deal for both sides...But it seems they not in hurry to leave...morons...
1/1	A no-deal, WTO Brexit will be a WONDERFUL Brexit. All the stupid scaremongering by the Remoaner liars, cowards and traitors reminds me of all the ridiculous stories about the 'millennium bug'/ Remember those?

0/1/1	A part of me hopes we get a no deal just so the British populace can get some perspective. This level of arrogance and anti-intellectualism is actually sickening for what is meant to be a first world nation. When did believing and rhetoric overtake models and actual evidence based analysis.

1	A quite brilliant speech about the increasing dangers of the Soviet-style EU and its threat to our democracy.
0/0	A really well thought out argument, and one I agree with to an extent. However, I voted remain as I feel change to the structure and function of the EU would be easier from inside the club.
0/0	A referendum based on the Brexit deal with undisputed facts and figures. People need to know that the economy will decline and they will be poorer. The government must also clearly state that the net result of immigration is positive.
1	A referendum was conducted and the result was for Britain to leave the EU. It was a democratic process and should be respected. If these people cannot accept the decision made by the majority, they are free to leave Britain and settled in any of the EU states.

0/0	A second referendum is better than sticking to a vote made in ignorance
0/0	A second referendum is inevitable
0/1	A second referendum will also be like a red rag to a bull to the Vote Leave camp - they will flood the country with fraudulent leaflets like the one which was banned by order of the Courts. It claimed - a blatant lie - that Uniliver, Nissan, Toyota, Honda et al wanted the UK to leave the EU.
0/0	A second referendum without the lies told by the far right loonies would be the best result. Brexit was a bad idea, everyone knows it now, and they could save themselves a lot of pain by just admitting that and moving on.

1/0	A stupidly over-simplified version of events. But then I suppose it is meant for americans. If the EU was just a trade agreement there wouldn't be a problem.
0/0	A tiny part of me says just go for it, crash out and therefore stop embarrassing and demeaning a once great country! Sick of apologising for this nonsense. But then reason kicks in and we have to continue exposing and challenging these imbeciles.
1/1	A trade free zone?! Really?! How about our nett contributions? Is that not a charge for access to your “free” trade zone?
0/0	A tragic day for the UK.
0/0	A triumph of democracy? Hahaha ... today is a triumph for Britain's oligarchs and the entire elite in the UK who have managed to blame the EU for the public's feelings of discontent. With the help of the tabloids that these oligarchs own they have been able to brainwash the people into voting Brexit. Soon hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost, prices in the shops will soar and worker's rights will be abolished. And these oligarchs will turn Britain into a low income low tax haven. The gullible and ill-informed British working man is the turkey that voted for Christmas. Flagwaving always works in the end.

0	A very sad day...... #RejoinEU
0/0	A very sad moment. But it was good to see that the removal of the Union Flag from the line up of all of the nations who make up the EU was done with dignity. If only Nigel Farage and his fellow Brexit MEPs hadn’t behaved in such a crass and arrogant manner and made an equivalent dignified exit from the chamber on Thursday? All he did was to bring shame on our beloved country and show what a narcissistic twerp he is.
0/0	A very upsetting moment for the UK.
0/0	A vote based, purely and simply, on BIGOTRY!! That's the bottom line.
1/1	A vote for Remain is a decision to hand democratic decision making to people over whom we have virtually no control. #IVotedLeave
1/0	A vote to remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy.
1/1	A vote to stay is a vote for Poverty for you and your Family, as a vote to stay is a vote for millions more immigrants to come to Britain all unskilled and Claiming Benefits of one sort or another. Think of your Family if they need health care or a operation but can't get an appointment because the migrants have taken up all the beds. Think of your Children and Grandchildren when they can't get a job or Training because we are over populated because half of Europe wants to live here on Benefits and free Health care. There is only one way to vote and that is to Vote To Leave .
1/1	A well written piece, correct to highlight the risks of those in the EU who would seek to expand the federalist EU, the federalists have been too loud for too long in Europe, and its no wonder that for some the vote to leave the EU was a vote to leave an administrative body, to lose a layer of politics that felt excessive. If the option at some point in the future is for this to be an economic union, not a political, judicial, military and social union, then the UK should be seeking a return....
0/-1	A woeful lack of understanding then since unity would be required to get an agreement especially in the time now available. Divide and conquer has served the UK well. But that time has passed
1/1	A wonderful day ! Great to hear Big Ben bong.
1/1	A wonderful moment for those of us who voted to leave in June 2016
1/1	A year ago I might have said stay in the EU. But because Sturgeon wants us to stay in (greed!) I will now vote to leave
0/0	A year on. Still no fucking plan for Leaving. What an achievement.
1/1	ABC is the epitome of what Britain voted against far left/right elite out of touch snobs. Would America really let 26 other countries tell them what they can and can not do. and have unlimited immigration or be called racists. America would no way accept that, so why should Britin
1/1	ABOUT DAMN TIME. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
1/0	AFTER WW2 GERMANY ENDED UP RUNNING EUROPE , AND THEY SAY THEY LOST THE WAR TUT TUT!!!!
1/1	ALL workers Voted LEAVE.
0/0	Aah, Brexit was because they wanted to prevent Indians to immigrate? What a stupid bunch...
0/0	About as good an idea as voting Trump.
0/0	About as good an idea as voting Trump. Although at least in America's case the majority didn't vote for Trump.
1/-1/1	About bloody time did something in OUR favour 😮😮😮, or has it just opened floodgates even more
1/1	About bloody time. The people have spoken, this is what the majority voted for.. Happy Days
0/0	About brexit, It all goes to hell
1/1	About time our parliament started standing up for the Uk
1/-1	About time we had someone who put UK first...
1/1	About time, how long has it been , 4 years after the British people voted to leave the corrupt EU, but their is a transition period that will last a year where the British will still have to obey the crap laws from the EU. If we only never joined the corrupt EU in 1973,
1/1/0/1/1	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
1/1	About time. The lefty tossers will read Marx verbetem.
0/0	Absolute bullsh*t. #Brexit IS populism. UKIP and fascists are stirring BECAUSE of Brexit. You don't get to lie about that. #Remain is now the will of the people. There will be a #PeoplesVote - and the UK will #stay in the #EU.
0/-1	Absolute chaos, London burns down, massive civil war, a dictatorship will be formed under rule of the monster raving loony party, uk renamed, Union Jack will have a goose on it and cats will be mauling people on the streets
1/1	Absolute farce. Remain have killed democracy.
0/0	Absolute fucking horse shit. Maybe for the lucky few. Social mobility in this country is horendous, leaving the european union will only exasperate this problem.
0/0	Absolute insanity. Why would any rational person want to jeopardize their own freedom of movement in Europe? Is it really worth the time and effort to divorce one’s country from the entire European economic community just to keep immigrants out?
0/0	Absolute, mind blowing, totally avoidable insanity!! What the hell has May done to the UK!!
1/-1	Absolutely ! , I’ve been saying this for years ! 👏👏
1/1	Absolutely bang on we voted out full stop with all the challenges that come with it . Not a little bit out or halfway out we vote OUT .
0/0	Absolutely crazy to leave peace and prosperity as a key player in Europe behind. Do you really believe things were better in Britain before the EU. We are far better off in - quality of live, economic and environmental prosperity.
0/0/0	Absolutely nothing to celebrate. Brexit is an appalling act of national self harm. I am absolutely devastated to have had my EU citizenship stripped away through no fault of my own.
0/0	Absolutely! What a disgrace. One (maybe the only) silver lining of Brexit is that they’re no longer going to be there supposedly representing us!
0/0	Absurd reply by Johnson when journos ask him about the possibility of no trade deal: "We already have a deal....and it's a great deal!" He gets more like Trump every day. #BBCNews #Brexit
1/1	Accept the will of the people. We voted for Brexit.
1/1/1	Access to British waters is traditional only in the last 47 years. So paws off! Our food standards are better. Our animal rights are better. Our workers legislation is better. Our Prime Minister is better. Our people are better. So bog off. How dare they make demands. We are a free and Independent Nation, like Australia, or Japan. Again...bog off.
0/0	Access to expertise, (medical/technological...) is the main factor in human survival rates. That makes respect for expertise an evolutionary imperative. The overwhelming majority of experts told us not to Brexit, making it an evolutionary failure.
0/0/0	According to Bloomberg Economics, by the end of this year Brexit will have cost Britain some £200bn in lost economic growth – nearly as much (adjusted for inflation) as the country has paid in to the EU budget over the entire period of its membership since 1973.
0/0	According to Brexiteers, now that we've detached ourselves from the evil EU, we can now start to rebuild the British Empire. It's quite simply, we're going to order all the other countries to make a magical trade deal with us to our liking and all those that refuse we shall declare war on them and take what we want. There... Sorted!
0/0	Accordingly once the UK leaves the EU and stops to serve a submarine into the EU disturbing further Integration, the UK will lose most of her importance for the US (and others).
1/1	Actually I would back the British to reject the EU once again. As negotiations progress more and more people are see ing the EU for what it is, even though we are bombarded daily with pro EU propaganda.
0/0	Actually Macron (you reference France) won power on the promise of change. Reactionary forces are causing havoc now because they oppose change. Brexit will not bring about positive change: stay tuned. It's a reactionary ploy that will only benefit the super rich.
0/0	Actually can't stop thinking about fact that we are now at the stage of Brexit where companies are about to stop some global exports, because they take 6 weeks to arrive, and they won't know what Britain's global trading arrangements will be by the time the stuff gets there.
0/0	Actually in a democracy it is the votes that count, whatever the motivation. Remain won the most seats. So remain won.
0/0	Actually it's not a vote for the UK because Scotland will go independent if we vote BrExit so we will be little England again.
0/0	Actually poor British people have the most to lose from a no deal Brexit. Including many of the idiots who were cheering it on Friday night.
1/1	Actually the country, most of us are united in leaving.
1/1	Actually there are a lot of valid reasons to leave -leaving means we regain sovereignty -we have control of our waters so our fishing businesses with thrive -we have the ability to open trade links with economically thriving countries, India, China, America without having to follow the EUs legislations on how much we can trade and the trading policies -the eu won't cut trading with the UK, we import more than we export to them so they would lose more than us through making cuts
0/0	Actually who have suggested te brexit in First place? It really is not a smart move...the World is globalized and be out of it...is...stupidity
1/1	Actually, that's just about the only good thing about delaying Brexit
1/1	After 3 years of remoaner moaning, lies and project fear even if it was true no one would believe them. Who would you trust most the US or some of these tupenny halfpenny EU countries that have only just got electric and the telephone?.
1/1	After 43 years; time for our independence! #VoteLeave #EUreferendum #voteout #IndependenceDay #votetoleave #brexit
0/1	After 47 years End of German-France Dictator in EU. Free UK.
1/1	After 47 years as obnoxious troublemakers in the EU, I think many Europeans thought that way! Thank goodness we got rid of the dead weight
1	After 47 years... FREEDOM!
0/-1	After 47 yrs the Leavelings got what they wanted, albeit by respecting a vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law. They were aided by a weak & ineffective opposition. Now they must respect my democratic right to campaign to rejoin. Unfinished business
1/1/0	After Brexit is implemented, Members of the UK Parliament will lose the ability to point at Brussels as “the 1blem”.
0/0	After Brexit it will be like this everyday, probably worse!!!
0/0	After Brexit the next step probably will be the SCexit (Scotland exit from UK).. You see pride and arrogance make people very stupid!
1/1	After Brexit, the United Kingdom will have greater control over its own industrial laws, and its significantly tighter borders following its separation from the European Free Movement range mean fewer immigrants will enter the country.
1/-1	After Brexit, welcome coronavirus!
0/1	After Briton falls apart King Arthur will pull the sword from the stone and proceed to drive out the Saxon Horde, uniting all of Britannia in the process.
0/0	After about 40 years of membership the UK is one of the richest countries in the EU and is growing at a satisfactory rate.
0/0	After all the damage Brexshit has caused who on earth is going to follow us
1/1	After all the doomongering about a Brexit no deal the economy appears well set and in comparison with the EU, Italy and Germany in recession, looks buoyant. A no deal seems our best bet especially those with mortgages.
1/1	After brexit Ireland may become one nation
1/1	After decades of economic bonanza in the E.U., Britain is near zero growth now. Surely things will be much better after Britain crashes out of the E.U.
1/1	After expressing clear concerns about backstop needing to be sorted Im backing the Graham Brady amendment- this will empower PM in discussions with EU and give closure which is necessary to deliver the Brexit the people voted for in 2016. Let’s get brexit delivered!
0	After leaving you want friendship with all nations and relationship. Hahah no!!! Leave means leave. Thats how you wanted.
0/0	After more than two years, the British still do not know what they want.
0/-1	After signing the agreement, Mr Michel said that "things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain". "We start a new chapter as partners and allies," he said. Hmm, it seems like only days ago the rhetoric from Brussels was of punishment for the UK. What's changed? Maybe a realisation that when it comes to trade we both benefit from co-operation. Of course with an annual surplus of £94bn the EU27 benefit a bit more than we do.
1/-1	After the #googletax deal, we need to restore faith in our tax system @johnmcdonnellMP #bbcqt
1/1	After the Brexit, the UK will be more competitive, because the UK can work with other countries to develop trade agreements and laws that are in line with its own manufacturing. We should leave the European Union
1/1	After the absurd amount of regulations, and dangerous legislation like Article 13, it's a wonder anyone would want to stay in the EU.
1/1	After the fall of communism and before unification, was the border between West & East Germany a problem?
0/0	After the racist disaster that was the Tory conference and the poisonous remarks by Amber Rudd which has enraged the moderates in the UK, the country is probably something like 60% Remain and 40% leave now...
0/0	After this week’s Commons vote, I confess I have never held MPs in lower esteem. Never in my lifetime has the profession so abandoned judgment and responsibility, in favour of personal ambition and party advantage.
0/1	After two devastating wars, the members of the EU were at peace with each other for 70 years. Something that had not happened in Europe in recent (and also not so recent) history.
1	After we Vote Leave, British businesses will trade freely with the EU
1/1	After we leave we will be free to agree trade deals with our old partners, as well as new ones, like the more open China.
1/1	After years of struggling, UK finally leave the European Union starting from 1 Feb 2020.
0/1/1	After years of trying to convince idiots that being in the EU is fully, wholly and completely in Britain's interest, I shall be voting to leave the EU. Why? Because people refuse to listen. They're so indoctrinated with the media's version of what the EU is and does they have no need for facts, or the broader realities of the EU. Fine. Let's go. Let's see how leaving the EU squares up to your moronic fantasies. Ignorance has a price. Time to settle the bill.
0/0	Again Britain's exceptionalism and arrogance. The UK is not a teamplayer.
0/0	Again. I'm a Londoner sending my most heartfelt disdain and hatred to #brexit. There are 8.65m of us. #StopBrexit
0/0	Against Brexit....Against Trump. Maybe Oliver should stop telling us what he's against so much, he seems to have a bad track record.
0/0	Against. Not at all convinced that the good things the EU spends money on in the UK (infrastructure, science etc) would be spent in a similarly wise way by Westminster. Also concerned about the risk to the City - afraid they will lose business to Frankfurt.
0/0	Against. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy
0/0	Agitated leavers should note that most EU migrants did not cost the country for their education, will not do so in retirement and pay lots of tax despite being low users of public services. In other words, they subsidise the angry Kippers who are all hot and bothered about imaginary concepts of sovereignty. Better think who is going to pay to keep the country running. I don’t hear Farage or Boris providing that answer.
0/0	Agree - vote for any party that is anti-brexit.
0/0	Agree no deal, let’s start to Export Bananas and privatize NHS since there will be no money!
0/-1	Agree whole heartedly as the so called leader of the UK she is pityful. Backs party and the privilege classes above everything. Ignoring" the will of the people"!!
0/0	Agree: Stop Brexit!
0/0	Agreed and likewise ! Trust is broken - smashed - and every time a 2nd world war reference is made I feel sick . I always suspected this , but never has it been so clear . UK is obsessed by 2 world wars and 1 World Cup. The mere mention hypnotises many into tribal trance mode.
0/0	Agreed, though all this FREEEEEDOM stuff is probably somewhat enabled by other events in UK politics. The English have found a uniquely destructive outlet, is all.
1/1	Agreed. I'm a strong Leave person but after Brexit we want to be good friends with all of Europe, Germany included. Such derogatory terms serve only to agitate. The reality is Germany may be the only one who can steer the EU towards a trade-focused deal that benefits us all. So...apologies. But we do need the German government to listen to German industry.
0/0	Agreed. We failed to sell our vision. We failed to obtain a good deal from the eu and then 3 years later we lost an election to Boris. They will never forget our incompetence.
0/0	Ah celebrating their right to become more irrelevant.
0/1	Ah mate how can you honestly go to Barack Obama and get him to say Britain will go to the back of the QUEUE really!?! You know what the British people sick and tired of rebuilding Poland: Second World, Cold War and 2008 Crash your country was doing just fine while ours struggled we bank rolled you FACT. Now the time has come to cash our chips you owe us a big pile of cash and we will go to court to get it back you defrauded our benefit system. Andrew John Metcalf - Commander in Chief
0/0/0	Ah well, fuck it, they've been told repeatedly it was a bad idea from the start, so if it goes through we just move onto holding them to account for their lies and deceit made to the British public as the country progressively gets poorer and their deception is laid bare.
1/1	Ah yes I'm sure that's just what the UK population wants, foreign business people trying to tell them what to do, under the guise of just being friendly to the UK. I'm certain part of the reason we voted to leave was to stop having to take orders from a foreign body.
1/-1	Ah yes..the Bloomberg bias
0/0	Ah, Brexit! The idiots gift that just keeps on giving!
0/0	Ah, look at all of those old, blithering idiots waving their flags of the Union Jack like simpletons. Only 5-7 more years until 3/4 of that crowd kicks the bucket lmao.
1/-1/0	Ah, this is great that we have independence from the EU, now time to have ourselves an independent Scotland! FREEEEDOOOOM
0/0	Aha we have discovered, The Brexiteers see the world Upside-Down, a form of yoga
1/0	Ahead of her appearance at the #BrexitCelebration in Parliament Square tonight, Ann Widdecombe takes a break from stirring the cauldron of her 'cure the gays' experiment, in order to reveal her outfit for the evening.
1/0	Ahhh our friends spreading their love. They should fk off. They destroyed out fishing coasts, families and businesses and turned them almost non-existent. Our waters- and it's non-negotiable
0/1	Airbus and Ford warn of dire consequences if Brexit goes badly
0/0/1	Airbus has said after the 2016 referendum, if there was a no deal or hard Brexit, they will leave the UK, so Airbus CEO statement is fact not scare mongering.
0/-1	Alas England is not an island.
0/0	Alas it would appear that the generation that I belong to all of whom economically benefitted from the 80s and 90s, disproportionately, decided that future generations should not have the same benefits and voted Leave!
0/-1	All BS fascism, has got the world in its pocket; we are just pawns, fighting each other. We live as brothers or die as fools.
0/0	All Brexit can say agsinst any advice to remain is Project Fear, Sack Him etc etc, Brexit don't want t hear anything but their own voices and they still can't give us any plans post an EU exit.
0/0	All Brexit does is take power from the EU and hand it to the cold, hard-right tories.
1/0	All Brexit does is weaken Europe as a whole, thus weakening the democratic stronghold of the world.
0/0	All Brexit seems to be doing is making existing problems far worse whilst creating enormous new problems at the same time
0/0	All Brexiteers are living in the past; some in the 19th Century, some at the height of the British Empire, and some of them in June 2016; none of them accept that the country has changed.
0/0	All Brits are forever stained as entitled morons apparently
0	All I can say is that I'm glad I don't live in England right now. I have the luxury of watching my homeland go to shit from the other side of the planet where the wife and I have stable, pretty well-paid jobs. I see a lot of instability in all kinds of sectors in England in the next few years.
0/0	All I can say is what a fucking joke. It's so ironic they paraded the big bastard of a bus around with "we will give 200 million to the NHS" and then it turns out they lied already fucked me up, now this shit…
0/0	All I can say is, I hope you folks know what your doing.
0/0	All I can say it's that we live in a world that it's conneced wether we want to admit it or not and since we are bond, we are like a chain, one country can harm the rest of the ones that are near by, so I belive that the UK leaving the EU will be a high toll to pay in the near future and the worst part it it's not a win-win to anyone.
0/0	All I can see is the UK, losing out in a huge way in the long run. This is a example, of people not appreciating, or understand what they have. The general UK public are ignorent, of the EU because they are not told or explined, what the EU is and the benefits that it gives them. All they hear and get through the different media's are all of the negatives and bias reports through the media . The EU, is the future for all the European state's, it's for the next generation , and the generations to come.
0/0/0	All I can tell is it seems like a complete mess.
1/1	All I wanted was to leave you EU and the government keeps messing it up so a hard brexit and then move forward form there.
0/-1	All I'd like to know is; we are the poorest county in the UK receiving a fair few million from the EU. How much would the Brexit campaign pledge to spend down here if we were to leave?
1	All MP.s should lose a day's pay for every day after the 29th March that they fail to deliver what was promised in the Referendum result.
0/0	All are welcome please ignore Brexit bigotry
0	All because the little Englander's xenophobia got the best of them. Sad to think that a lot of people had made their minds up before the election or any campaigning. Today, we have truly gone backwards as a nation.
1/1	All citizens of free Democratic Constitutional Republics must beware of leaders who are willing to sell their sovereignty for currency & trade their liberty for security. Congrats UK on your Independence day.
0/1	All down hill from now
1/1	All hail Britain! May she be Great again!
1/1	All i've heard is that if Britain leaves that may mean more jobs for the other countries that will take Britains side of the trade so i'm down with that, i live in Italy and we need more jobs here so gtfo britain.
1/1	All leave voters should boycott a second referendum in protest.
1/0	All liberals need to be rounded up and locked in a mental asylum.
1/-1	All national trade/collective negotiators will look for the best deal possible for their people. As for leverage, the UK are in trouble!
1/0	All of our problems will now fall at the feet of our own elected officials, clearly indicating who needs voting out.
0/0/0	All of this because millions of idiots hate seeing brown faces
0/0	All of this is because parliament ignored the will of the people.
0/0	All of which is perfect confirmation of why important and complicated matters like EU membership should never be trivialised and presented as a simple yes/no decision in a referendum.
0/0	All problems he mentioned are not related to Brexit, nor the EU. Simply failing of UK politics. Brexit will not improve the situation in the small rural communities, it will make it worse.
0/0	All roads lead to Putin. And he’s laughing his head off at his successful campaign to destroy the western world.
0/0	All signs point to REMAIN. Sorry guys, but your dream off booting people back to Dover is OVER. Open the floodgates I say.
1/0	All that's changing is that we're leaving a political structure that is wasteful, corrupt and completely unnecessary, in order for us to run our affairs.
1/1	All the British people want is for brexit to take place so the country can be INDEPENDENT again. In politics INDEPENDENCE is sacred and unnegotiable
1/1	All the benefits, hardly. The EU's policies have consistently delivered a weaker economy and worse economic performance than England, the currency deficit between the Euro and the Pound is just one example of this. On top of that, the governance policy and structure makes it essentially an autocracy where the highest governing offices are not elected, and are not answerable for their actions to the general public. Hell, the EU parliament only have voting rights on bills put forward by the unelected council, they can't propose motions on their own. Beyond that, the economic impact the leave is likely to have on England's economy is greatly overstated. Yes there is likely to be a downturn, but it will most likely be far less disastrous as anti-brexiters would have people believe. I believe the chance to free oneself from the autocratic, and economically inferior governance of the EU is worth the associated risks.
1/1	All the best for EU countries and new ones 🇪🇺we are happy 2nd days Great Britain
0/0	All the brainless losers who want a Brexit should have sign a contract saying they will put 50 grand each in to a kitty to refund us remainers when all these predictions of disaster turn out to be true. As Brexiteers all say this is just lies they can not have a problem with that because they will know it can not happen. Fair enough?
1/1	All the doom and gloom and crying for a do over the media push for said do over the fake google stories, the "oh you will never leave" followed by the "oh why even bother voting you wont win" and now "h-ahaha you messed up bet you want another go" all of that crap and here we are. It has been one day, and we are looking better than ever.
0/0	All the fishermen want out, but sell 90% of their langestines etc to EU. Brexit is bonkers.
0/-1	All the government's plans seem to assume we can simply go out and take other countries market share. It really isn't that easy or we would have done it already.
0/0	All the old people who voted Brexit will be the first in the supermarket emptying the shelves
1/1	All the remainers .can go and all the leavers can stay
0/-1	All the while our parents generation are happy getting exactly what they voted for, while they're totally insulated from any of the effects. Sickening.
0/1	All these companies will end up moving to somewhere besides Europe and the U.S. because of bad decisions being made all based on nothing but stupidity at the highest levels. I am glad I am old and do not want to be here as the decline of democracy unwinds.
0/0	All these elderly that voted to leave will die and will leave UK broken. I feel really sorry for the young people, that need a good future. Uk need new election as soon as possible. The country is divided, that's sad!
1/0/0	All this "Brexit Crisis" documentary and news briefing is designed to "educate" the electorate ahead of a second referendum so that all those who voted leave in the 2016 referendum will vote sensibly so that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.
0/0	All this "They need us more than we need them" BS will quickly unravel as the UK becomes a basketcase economy where many wont be able to afford a new car, import duties or not.
0/0	All this complication and expense, just so that old English people can feel like they stuck it to the Germans.
1/1	All this fear campaign demonstrates the desperation of the Remainers and the EU who have special interests. Where was all this fear campaign during the referendum?
0/0	All this nonsense about things somehow being the EUs fault. What utter delusion. At no point, ever, did we have any leverage - we have none now.
1/1	All those who want to remain in the EU, should be automatically be signed up for the new EU army, let’s see how many banners would be dropped then
0/0	All voting is fixed. Soros made a fortune on Brexit. The decision was made by the psychopathic elite to fit their agenda and fill their pockets.
1/1	All we want IS to get out of EU the sooner the better.
1/1	All we want is British Sovereignty returned to the People.
1/1	All you need to do is read the various EU Treaties (starting with the Treaty of Rome 1957 right through to the Lisbon Treaty) to see the absolute monster we've voted out of!
1/1	All yours Boris, well done. Don’t let down the fishermen please. Let’s put the Great back into Britain
1/-1	All, we will be introducing words of the week and words of the day for the next year. We suggest our followers use them when possible. The word of today is BREXIT The word of the week is BREXIT
0/0	Almost all UK chicken producers would be wiped out by Trump’s excrement-covered birds, but if any of them (farmers not birds) voted Brexit you can be sure that they knew wot they wuz vo’ing for - the dole q.
1/1	Almost all of the people where I work are Poles,, Romanians and Hungarians :(( only me and 1 other English person, It doesn't feel like England anymore :( I vote leave not because I am against immigrants, but because i feel that there is a limit to how many we can take
0/0	Almost every multi-national corporation will move outside of the UK. Stupid ass idiots got duped into believing Brexit was for the best. Thanks Putin.
1/1	Almost there, folks! #GetBrexitDone
0/-1/0	Alot of buissness left the UK.
1/1	Already about 5 big Merchant Banks have announced investment in the City of London - and that's after Brexit. We had all these scare stories the first time around about not joining the Euro would destroy the City and Stock Exchange - it didn't.
0/0	Already every bad consequence of Brexit or no deal has been blamed on the evil nature of the EU, it was inevitably going to go this way as their whole campaign to leave was built using the EU as a scapegoat for their own ineptitude and poor domestic policy decisions.
0/0	Already, even before we have left the EU, Brexit is damaging our country, our economy, our society and our standing in the world - damage that will be worsened by the kind of ruinous no deal being pledged by some who aspire to become prime minister.
1	Also, EU laws are passed by the European parliament, which is directly elected. Mind expanding on how laws are being dictated to you by an ‘unelected’ body, when they’re literally passed by a parliament? I suggest you ask yourself who’s really at fault for immigrants taking low wage jobs - the people trying to etch out a living, or the employers willing to take advantage of that?
0/0	Also, had a friend who runs a Belgian inspired beer bar and thought there were to many immigrants, despite his bar being fully staffed by eastern Europeans. I don't think you'll get a rational answer to this. Edit: both cases are people who said they voted leave.I Being an EU citizen, I didn't really know too many people in that crowd.
0/0	Also, polls show that the remain side is dominated by under 35's, with the leave side being significantly older. It's our generation that will be impacted by this decision, and unlike the xenophobic dinosaurs, we don't want to be stuck in a little Island with a wall built around it!
1/1	Although I am glad about us leaving the EU on Jan 31st 2020, am over the moon with the non alignment with EU after us leaving, also with trade talks coming to an end at the end of the year, I am not happy as an ex serviceman with the government allowing Cobham to asset stripped.
0/1	Although I think Brexit will be a disaster for the UK, in economic and politics, I think the referendum was legitimate.
0/0	Although in theory, solving brexit’s challenges could help alleviate genuine problems the UK has, it probably won’t.
1/1	Although leaving EU has a terrible consequences, but for me it may have promising benefits from it years after the leave itself--the UK may establish diplomatic relations and trade treaties to the commonwealth and other non-EU countries of interest, like Japan, Iceland, Norway, Chile or the Philippines to rebound their economic status
1/0	Although many of the people voting to leave are educated and smart I'd say the majority of them are closest racists.. There I said it
0/-1	Always know what's on the ballot. Big oops.
0/0	Always said 'Industrial workers' voting for Brexit were Turkeys voting for Xmas
1/1	Always united? We were never united even when we were part of the Eu! The only thing the Eu cares about is the UK taxpayer money. Good riddance.
1/1	Am I getting a bit ahead of myself here, but does the prospect of leaving the E.U. without a deal look better and better?
1/1/0	Am an indian and i believe the people voted for brexit are the real british.....No nationalist wanted to see their country becoming another Pakistan

1/1	Am right behind you Boris , love your determination even after this past week !!
0/-1	Amazing to discover that 100% of the general public in the UK appear to have Ph.D’s in international trade. The country’s economic future is undoubtedly assured.

0/1	America is Rejoicing for the UK! Congratulations!

1/1/1	American here wanting to wish you a happy Independence Day! Freedom and Security by Brits for Brits!
1/1	Among working-class voters, Boris has an amazing 44 to 17 per cent lead over Jeremy Corbyn. No wonder Labour strategists are so dismayed by the prospect of an election.
0/0	An Economic crisis is coming home.
1/0	An ORB spokesman said: “The poll shows that there is substantial support for pushing through with Brexit despite the potential consequences for the Union.
0/0	An act of economic stupidity based on xenophobia and Tory lies. The UK will rue this day! Hopefully Scotland charts an independent path back to the E.U. now that this Brexit folly has come to pass
0/-1	An advantage of Brexit is the lessons everyone else is learning.
1/1	An earthquake would be appreciated in the heart of Brussels to raise that SHITHOLE to the ground preferably with the EU leaders in IT
0/0	An embarrassing mistake. Great Britain will not be greater.
0/0	An excellent piece by Stephen Bush in the New Statesman. On post Brexit business and companies betting against the UK economy. Perhaps an indicator as to the negative impact Brexit will have on the UK.
1/1	An exciting new chapter opens in our country’s history - a refreshed opportunity to enhance our bonds and partnerships with nations across the world, advancing British values globally
1/1	An exit deal with the EU is beneficial for both parties
1/1/1	An impressive opening salvo from Boris. Keep up the good speeches!
0/0	An insane amount of money that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of just how much Brexit has cost the nation so far.
0/-1	An orderly Brexit depends on a united Tory party. So start stockpiling now
0/0/0	And Brexit is the mistake people never realised they made.
0/0	And Brexit just keeps on delivering the manure. Brexiteers - it is ALL YOUR FAULT from here on.
1/1	And I did get up in 2016 - to vote leave Brexit!
0/0	And I thought the british were intelligent people....
0/0	And Leavers think it's a good idea to leave the EU without ANY trade deals...
0/0/0	And Putin gets another win in his book.
0/0	And Putin's hold on continental Europe grows.
1/1/1	And THAT to the remainers is why we wanted to leave the EU gravy train! We are their largest exporter so they shall kneel before us eventually
1/0	And Terror begins
0/1	And Yes I do love Europe - very much actually -- at the time of voting, I didnt even understand why anyone would want to leave the EU.
1/1	And about going ‘back to Europe’ the UK is part of Europe and always will be - it just won’t be part of the EU numpty!
1/1	And about time, we should never have signed away our rights in the first place
0/0	And about to get a whole lot worse, as May is clearly stupid enough to trigger Art-L and go for a Hardshit Brexshit!
1/0	And after 'extra-time' it will go to penalties, and Germany will win.
0/0	And as regards all these EU laws and regulations that are supposed to blight my life, I have never come across any of them.
1/1	And by September last year, more of England's councils joined in, once more celebrating Brexit by pouring raw sewage
1/1	And for a little context ask yourself why these people want to remain?? business interests maybe? shares in places abroad?
0/0	And from tomorrow onwards when we see Tax Rises, Cost of Food Rises ect ect, that is when we will regret leaving the EU
1/1	And hopefully we then leave without a deal and it's a clean break
0/0	And idiots completely fell for the lie that is Brexit
1/1	And if Ireland enter our waters after Brexit they'll be cut off too.
1/1	And just to think there’s people in the U.K. think this vile organisation is wonderful.
0/0	And let's make the Rejoin campaign one of tolerance, decency and friendship
0	And life gets that little bit worse. Does it ever get a little bit better? I’m struggling to remember but no, not under a Conservative government it seems.
1/-1	And make no mistake, it was all down to Farage, even Boris getting a majority was down to him, so thanks Mr Farage, a job well done.
1/1	And many millions like me will be rejoicing at finally no longer being tied to the corrupt EU. The EU know we will be successful the reason they what to make it as difficult as possible to leave.
0/1	And millions of Turks will come to the UK. Not to mention that they'll be lazy living of benefits, while simultaneously stealing jobs!
0/0	And moreover Brexit will be a drag on every sector of our society. To make it a success would require a tremendous will and work from the entire population.
1/1	And never look back. EU has lost control of its borders. It's not too late for England to protect hers.
0/-1/-1	And nothing about it on the #ITVNews at 6.30pm either. Is it just me who thinks this is important.
0/0	And now Scotland gets independence and we join back to the EU
1/0	And now conservative has won (Boris Johnson) and now we are leaving
0	And now conservative has won (Boris Johnson) and now we are leaving .... i think.
1/-1	And now it’s time for a Nexit. The dutch are sick of it too, even though the MSM says they aren’t.
0/0	And now millions of people in the United Kingdom are denied the right to easily travel, work and attend school in other EU countries. And the currency's worth is at its lowest point since the 1980s.
1/1	And now straight a Nexit!
0/0	And so begins our long, great decline. Ring those bells. And light a candle for what remains of our little country.
1/1	And so like 1642 and 1776, 2019 is a date that a free people will remember. That or war
0/1	And so the betrayal of the British People Begins.
0/0	And so the nightmare begins
1/0	And so the sun sets on the British kingdom
1/1	And so what? Britain has a decision. For good
0/0/0	And soon Scotland and Northern Ireland will leave the U.K. in response. The Kingdom is shrinking...
0/0	And soon because of it there wont be a UK.
1	And still the bitterness continues. I just hope none of you posting on here are business people cos with your attitudes to change, we really will be toast
0/0	And stop presenting the EU as doing a no deal. The UK decided to leave, remember. All failings will be down to the leaderless Tories. Do t even try to blame the EU, you can try though.
1/1	And that is why the EU will ultimately fail to deliver ever closer political and economic union, it's going to make Europeans poorer.
0/0	And that's how Britain got screwed.
1/1	And that's part of the reason were leaving. The arrogant europeans have very little appreciation or respect for how the UK helped shape the eu. Out and onwards and upwards. The eu has turned into a bureaucratic technocratic nightmare tying everything up in red tape to keep all of its jobsworths employed and destroying the productive economy in the process. And the euro is a straight jacket of disastrous proportions. Glad we're getting out.
1/1	And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists.
1/1	And the Stop Brexit campaign continues. YOU LOST get over it!
0/0	And the benefits will be...?
1/1	And the blind remainers cannot see the way the EU treat the UK we are just Cash Cows out and stuff them and their cars Japanese are just as good
0/0	And the breixt voters still think they know better. If brexit does finally go through then it seems that the first problem the government of the day needs to tackle is eduction for it is clearly in a catastrophic state if so many in the country will continue pursue brexit despite the truth being known about all the leave claims and the conduct that has been uncovered.
0/0	And the famous Blue Passports ( which could have been printed anytime in the past) can now be printed by a French Company in Poland. The U.K. will more than likely have to pay tariffs on them as well. I think that in itself summarises Brexit !
0/-1	And the first domino falls.
1/1/1	And the good news keeps on coming for the UK post #Brexit As Facebook plan a huge new HQ at King’s Cross and Apple build
1/1	And the more the EU tries to hardball the UK, the more we are going to want to leave, and pay back the EU for its unfriendliness.
0/0	And the truly staggering thing is that probably half the people who voted for Brexit didn't even realize that it would mean the end of the UK. I guess if you're that blinkered then you deserve everything you get.
1/1	And then the PM decides that the vote was wrong and we’re still stuck in the same situation today.
1/1	And there you have it ladies and gentlemen of the remain campaign. From his own mouth. How much more do you need to hear and see? Grow a pair! We need to leave!
1/0	And they all laughed when Boris was voted party leader, and they all laughed when he had a minority Government, and they all laughed when he lost note after vote,
0/0/-1	And they announce 5% cuts for the north while before the election promised no cuts. Welcome to the "new era".
0/0	And they will loose all the benefits of open borders. At least I hope the EU will be strict in such cases and quits all treaties so the British people can FEEL that the EU didn't only wanted money of them and gave them a lot of economic advantages they will miss.
0/0	And this time it's real. Any last minute ideas to #StopBrexit?
0/0	And thus a decision was made that would massively screw over the country for years to come.
1/1	And to think only a couple of months ago we had a paralysed parliament that could only agree to disagree! Boris Johnson winning the General Election on December 12th will go down as one of the most important occasions in the history of the United Kingdom.
0/0	And tucking the people up along the way.
1/1	And we are fed up with career politicians who have no experience of the real world
0/1	And we want to leave the EU? It beggars belief.
1/0	And what about the will of the people? Remember them? The ones who voted to leave the EU by referendum? Oh that's right, I forgot you're an authoritarian cuck disguised as Mr. Bean.
0/0	And what happens to the millions of British people living, studying and working abroad? Imagine all the retired Brits in Spain coming back and claiming on the NHS.
1/-1	And what you expect when there are 9 muslims in the parliament
0/0	And why are they ignoring their own assessments that any Brexit will leave us all worse off? The only outcome that "betters the lives of British people" is to Remain.
1/-1	And winning Brexit with associated sallty remoaner tears It's a team sport, their team won, and that's it, we dont see it as a team sport. We're not both seeing the same "reality"
1	And yet remainiacs told us that Britain would have to apply to join the WTO but would be vetoed by Argentina
0/0	And yet some Brexiters still believe that the UK "holds all the cards" and that the EU will capitulate and give it what it wants.
1/0	And yet tomorrow nothing will have changed, we will all still be Europeans of course, still subject to the same rules and laws, but now without any say in how they are implemented. The only other difference is that it will be a Saturday, I do like Saturdays.
0/1	And yet, for all this "engagement" from the leavers, not one man Jack amongst them has managed to put forward a single compelling benefit of leaving, for however many years this has gone on.
0/0	Anger as Gove claims UK doesn’t ‘need’ trade deal with EU
0	Another American here. Sounds like that famous, European self-righteousness, smugness, and sense of superiority has rubbed off on you. Must be something in the water over there. No wonder the Brits want out
1/1/1	Another article that fails to understand Brexit or what’s going on in the UK. It’s subjective that it’s pointless. We want to leave the EU and FoM etc. Don’t you get it? We want it for good reasons.
1/1	Another brexit scare story put to bed
0/0	Another company I worked for in 2018 many colleagues were made redundant and staff moved to Amsterdam and both companies said it was due to Brexit and uncertainty.
1/-1	Another example of the British press delivering poor quality, irresponsible reporting to the easily influenced (to simple to conduct their own analysis) by the Daily Express.
0	Another global financial crisis is coming
1/1	Another great British victory over Europe
0/0	Another opportunity lost. This is what happens when you make plans to leave the world's largest trading bloc. Watch the Brexiteer politicians who sold this snake oil to the country yet again blame everyone and everything other than themselves.
0/1	Another victory for Vladimir Putin ...
0/-1	Another vote (Brexit) which was strongly manipulated by Russian military intelligence in order to create chaos. It's working there too
0/0	Answer: Don’t leave the European Union.
0/0	Any #Remainer out there, don't give Johnson the satisfaction of TV ratings. Don't watch, Turn the TV off, who wants to listen to a snivelling, lying cheat.There is nothing to celebrate in my opinion.
1/1	Any 'DEAL' means we're still IN !!!!!
0/0/0	Any British citizens want to enlighten us on how exactly this is going to change things for you? No sarcasm or snark intended, genuinely interested in an actual participant's take.
0/0	Any bad things that happen, even after the UK has left the EU, will still be because of the EU in the eyes of Brexiters.
1/-1	Any club (European Union) that wishes to deliberately punish a member for leaving sounds more like a gang to me....blood in and blood out. Why should the UK be threatened and punished for simply wanting to leave the club? I feel sorry for Italy and Spain who's economy would be completely destroyed by the all powerful EU (Germany and France) if they decided to leave. So let's say this again.....A club..that when you wish to leave..you get punished..... Can nobody else see that?
1/0	Any company moving from the UK due to Brexit, Brexit uncertainty or any other claim to Brexit should be boycotted by the UK public.
0/0	Any decent politician would now be saying that whilst it's clear many people voted to leave, we cannot reach an agreement that will truly be in the best interests of the country & bring the people from both sides together. We must therefore #RevokeA50, #Remain & reform within.
0/0	Any evidence to support your rhetoric? Unicorns are not real BTW.
0/0	Any financial forecast is guesswork from either side. I think you've got to Base this on what sort of person you want to be, insular and fearful of outsiders and collaboration, or open and willing to help and work with others. I also do think you have to look at who is campaigning on either side, if you want to align yourself with Nigel Farrage and Michael Gove then you get what you deserve.
0/0	Any form of Brexit makes our security harder to manage.. The harder the Brexit, the greater the damage.
0/-1	Any form of indoctrination is unhealthy. Kids should be taught to have an open mind, not a closed mind. The world would be a much better place if this were the case!
0/0	Anybody thinking a no deal is good is just ignorant on economics and trade. The British can not be trusted and the world is watching on how they conduct themselves.Who would do a deal with this backsliding country.
0/0	Anyone aged over 50 must not be allowed to vote in the referendum. It is not their future to decide.
1/1	Anyone else fed up with the propaganda from these Common Purpose led political clowns?
0/0	Anyone else feel like we are in the set up of another world war
0/0	Anyone else find it interesting that LEAVE voters type like TRUMP?
1/1	Anyone in their right mind should vote to leave the EU political union, we want their trade, not their politicians and policies.
0/0	Anyone know the collective noun for a group of elderly, racist #brexit jihadists?
0/0	Anyone now supporting a 'no deal' Brexit is a threat to my family, business and the country. It's becoming quite clear that they are prepared to accept any degree of damage to the UK and its people, including loss of life.
0/1	Anyone planning a party? This should be the biggest celebration of your life's!! 29 March 2019. #Brexit
0/0	Anyone surprised ? Weaker country, weaker currency How anyone thinks the we can get a better trade deal than the one we have just given up, is beyond me.
1/1	Anyone who opposes Brexit is a fascist
0/1	Anyone who still can't see the malevolence of the #EU is out to destroy the very fabric of our civilization
0/0	Anyone who supports Brexit is an idiot
0/0	Anyone who thinks brexit will help trade is a moron, if India wanted anything we have they could buy it already, cutting the cost of British wine by 5% isn't going to do a god damn thing
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Anyone who voted for brexit should be sent to a mental asuylm then be shipped off to prison for 3 life sentences to be served back to back for crimes against the people of the UK
1/1	Anyone who wanted to stay in the European union should emigrate to a another country that has remained in the EU theres plenty more of them
0/0	Anyone who wants a no deal is someone who will make a lot of money at everybody's expence.!
1/1	Anyone would think that UK hadn't survived for hundreds of years without the EU. Trade is much more global now and the politics of the EU are anathema to a freedom loving country. Do your worst Globalists, UK will be the first to leave, will it be the last? I think not. Time will tell.
1/1	Anything is better than bowing down to a bureaucratic super state that hold democracy and individual freedom 2nd to their dream.
0/0	Anything is better than brexit.
1/1	Anything that hurts the EU is a good thing.
0/0	Anything that reduces the cohesiveness of the European project is something that the Russians have been pursuing. It is a divide and conquer strategy that they are implementing. The people in the EC are only now getting around to figuring it out, too little too late.
0/0	Anything to help his mega rich donors. Brexiteers can’t seem to see what is obvious to everyone else. The EU were a bulwark against U.S. type capitalism, it was a force field that the extremist right in this country despised. You reap what you sow, you’ll soon find out exactly what Britannia unchained is all about for you and your family personally.
1/0	Apart from that, the people of the UK should be able to hold their elected representatives responsible for events bought about by bad policy. The way I see it, you can't do this because EU bureaucrats in Brussels actually call the shots.
0/-1	Apart from the likelihood of being stabbed, tripping over a homeless, no access to quick healthcare, shite transport links and a housing market no-one can join from the bottom.
0/0/0	Apart from the racism and the loss of EU funds and the further loss of jobs in Wales, the Midlands and the North and the collapsing pound and the further unemployment everything is coming up roses.
1/1	Apart from the traitor and war criminal Tony Blair, Theresa May has become the most hated PM in this decade. If she forces another eu referendum she can count me out, as I will NOT vote again as I already voted to leave, and my vote is still the same. I hear people crying on the streets of Britain, "Off with her head".
0/0	Apparently the Tories refuse to accept reality. Either that or they actually WANT to destroy the country.... which I hope is not the case but I suspect it is.
0/0/1	Apparently the pickle pizza is just as divisive as #Brexit...
0/0	Apparently we have lots and lots of opportunities being outside the EU. Such as...?
1/1	Apparently you're not allowed to court-martial your paperboy any more if he forgets your Daily Star. Yet another reason we need to #getbrexitdone
0/0	Appealed to their most base instincts - fear and racism
1/0	Applicants must have the unrestricted right to live and work in the EU.” British only nationality not good enough.
0/1	Arch Remoaner Lord Adonis accuses BBC of 'radicalising' public to vote for Brexit! BBC biased TOWARD Brexit?
0/1	Arch-Leaver here: agree, esp. re: minority of Britons being xenophobes, however, they voted in '16. I'd probably say it's because we are an archipelago of diverse peoples that we're so outward looking, liberal and tolerant. Additionally — isn't our Union the (pretty much) the least xenophobic state in the EU28?
1/1	Are Remainers just going to moan forever and then when Brexit is a great economic success still maintain they were right and we just got lucky? I think so.
0/0	Are leavers just pretending not to know that we’re in a transition period where nothing changes or do they genuinely not realise? #Brexit
0/0	Are the Brexit muppets even aware that when they talk about their country being the fifth largest economy in the world they are stating they are from India.
0/0	Are the English seeking to become a part of the U.S.? Are they willing to drop the monarchy? Why are U.S. flags flying lower than British flags? It seems they fell victim to the same thing the u.s. did. Unaddressed problems solved with the worst possible solution. We have trump, they have those other dumbasses. The Daily Show made a joke, if this were a movie it would be obvious. Those dudes with crazy hair are aliens and are trying to mess you up. Interesting times.
0/-1/1	Are there any Brexiteers out there who went to see 1917? I have been put off because the writer and director said it was anti Brexit? Dunkirk was one of the worst films I have ever seen and the last Bond was poor. I don't want to waste my time on another bad picture.
0/0	Are there any real pro brexit arguments that aren’t about tax avoidance or hating the foreigners?
1/0	Are they Deaf Daft Or just Dumb. We don,t wan,t a Customs Union free trade WTO now.
0/-1	Are they going to plan what to do next by tossing up one of those new ten Bob bits heads kiss the left cheek of trumps arse tails the right?
0/0	Are we about to see the greatest brain drain in history?
0/0	Are you asking brextards if they voted for brexshite
1/1	Are you in or out? Does the UK really want to be governed by people that are unelected?
0/0	Are you seriously this ignorant? You've let this "can't happen to me" bullshit get in your head. Brexit shouldn't impact me with any significance either(as far as I can tell) but the way things are going it's going to fuck a lot of people. If you can't recognise that reality, you are very fucking naive. It's not out of character, Leave voters seem to be oblivious to the fact that their decision is going to literally cost some people their lives if we crash out of the EU.
0/0	Are you speaking on behalf of those UK businesses dealing with EU partners
1/0	Are you still in Europe??? Please get the hell out.of the UE...we dont need a tiny Island like you....Britannia never again will be nothing relevant....enjoy Trump
0/0	Are you sure you want to take away the rights of free movement, throw away trade deals, put unity and stability of EU at risk and jeopardise the integrity of UK?
1/1	Are you willing to put on a Yellow jacket and take to the streets if the 29th of March isn't the date we leave the EU in essence #Brexit #UKIP
0/0	Around 3.5 million British jobs are directly linked to British membership of the European Union’s single market – 1 in 10 British jobs.
1/1	As BREXITEERS, we just want what we, the majority voted for! I have never wished harm on any remainer..they are entitled to their opinion but have to come to terms with the fact they were out-voted!
1/1	As Brexiters leaders promised, UK has just signed 40 new Free Trade Deals and NHS have started to recive the extra £50M per day.
0/0	As Britain has declared its intent to become a total outlaw country, the black market will thrive and the legitimate economy is finished
1/1	As Churchill famously stated in Parliament in 1953 We have our dreams and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it.
0/-1	As EU-citizens we would like to participate in the referendum and vote for Brexit.
0/0	As I predicted - Brexit is going to be one phuck of a train wreck.....
0/0	As I say goodbye to another friend this week leaving the UK for a job in the EU I am still at an utter loss as to why we are doing this. There are no benefits in my mind in a world where we need allies and friends across the world to combat climate change. It makes no sense to me and the hate filled comments and gloating of the leavers makes it unbearable.
0/0	As Nissan scraps plans to build their X-Trail model in Sunderland, I'm reminded that 61.3% of people there voted for Brexit. And this is how some of the idiots celebrated. I'll be saving my sympathy for people who deserve it.
1/1	As a Brexiteer I must vote this biased analysis down. You didn’t even try.
1/1	As a Brexiteer I say good. Nobody wanted May's pathetic deal and she couldn't be trusted to get us out of the EU.
1/1	As a Brit living in the Netherlands, Britain really will benefit long term with a No Deal Brexit. Expect Italy or even France to follow in due course while the Brits get out their popcorn.
0/0/0	As a Brit, Brexit breaks my heart.
0/0	As a Brit, I see the UK situation as just as embarrassing as the US situation. It’s possible to laugh at both.

0/0	As a British person...... I can say with confidence that I hate British people. I am sorry for all those that have to put up with us Britons 😂
1/1	As a British tax payer why should I subsidize countries in eastern Europe and why should they lose all their professional elites to us. The EU is not working.
0/0	As a British, after Brexit, we are not free to travel in Europe, I hate Brexit.
1/1	As a Chartered Engineer, I can assure you we're well skilled to look after UK's engineering needs.
1/1	As a Commonwealth Citizen from Singapore, I exercised my right to vote and I supported Leave.

0/0	As a European l have to say goodbye and good luck being Trumps sock puppet. You only have yourselves to blame
1/1	As a European who studied and worked in London for a total of five years with many friends on the island, I am bloody proud of the people taking the stand for Brexit. It is a great part of getting the Sovereignity back. I can only hope that my country one day will take the same decision. You have defended European countries and shedded blood in two disastrous wars for freedom. You are now taking a stand against EUSSR. You are too big to bully!

0/0	As a UK citizen living in the EU I'm terrified of this outcome as I haven't lived in the UK for almost a decade. They would literally have to drag me kicking and screaming to return there.

0/0	As a brit, Brexit makes me feel sick. Still an EU citizen at heart, wish I could be labelled European British
0/0	As a citizen of the Czech Republic, I'm so for the idea of a bigger political organization where everyone is equal. I'm not saying I want Europe to be one country. I just wish people realized that all European nations have so much in common and that together we are stronger.
1/0	As a citizen of the US, it makes me feel a bit better. Sort of like seeing that your friend also hadn't studied for a major exam.
0	As a continental I am relieved to see that the gullible Brexiteers are in the minority and the British public can see through the lies and false media
1/1	As a developed country, I don’t think we need to accept EU financial integration. This is obviously a disadvantage for us.
1/1	As a diehard Brexiteer I say: leave means leave! Don't let door hit you on way out!
1/1	As a eurosceptic I'm delighted at how piss poor the 'Remain' campaign are. All they have is scaremongering, near enough all of it 'the sky will fall in' by laying out the worst case scenario.
1/0	As a french, I can tell you than none of us want you to stay. Frenchmen have seen your first vote as a treason to the cooperative project between all the european's nations. That's why we hope that you are not going to have a second vote and are going to leave the EU without any deal or with a deal in EU's leverage.
0/0/0	As a historian I fear Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety
0/0	As a law student, we're staying IN !
1/1	As a lifelong Conservative voter, I am appalled and disgusted by this abject surrender by Lord Halifax..., sorry, by May, to the EU bullies. At least the USA has a leader that stands up for his own people and country. May and her gang of traitors have betrayed the British people yet again. Whether it's Brexit, multiculturalism, islam, crime, defence spending or half a hundred other topics that vex and dismay the people, you can be assured our smug self satisfied political elite will subvert or ignore the people they supposedly represent.
0/-1	As a nation, we just don't fancy you anymore, so if
1/0	As a non-Brit observing the referendum, I was a staunch supporter of Remain. Since then, I've become somewhat more sceptical of free trade and the European Union, although it's just as obvious now as it was then that Brexit was an opportunistic attempt at careerism for most of the Leave leaders, that's gone horribly off the rails. It's an international case of schadenfreude that the UK will never live down. If another vote was held today, I would be a reluctant Remain supporter.
1/1	As a part of the younger generation I'm NOT sad about this. So relieved to be out of the anti-democratic, protectionist, corporate bureaucracy that is the EU. We're a free global nation again, not locked away as a prisoner in fortress Europe. Hello USA, Hello China, Hello India, Etc. :D
0	As a pro independence Scot, I am fully backing remain, despite a successful leave vote potentially triggering a new independence referendum here. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are all being polled as strongly voting remain. This is England's referendum and the rest of us are being dragged along for the ride. The leave side is also using similar arguments that they condemned the Scots for using in the independence referendum which is mildly infuriating. Examples include Nigel farage crying out for the Queen to intervene in the Scottish referendum and in the past few months he has criticised Prince William for giving a pro EU speech and the 'no' campaign in Scotland for independence called the yes campaign xenophobic and racist towards English people and yet here we are ripping on immigration and foreigners. Nations historically always blame immigrants over addressing wider issues - Nazi Germany, Chinese blaming foreigners for Hong Kong protests, Red scares in the US being blamed for strike action etc. This is nothing different. As someone said to me the other day, the immigrants didn't crash our economy.
0/0	As a pro-EU person I acknowledge that Brexit Britain will be fine. Well, at least depending on what “fine” means to you. If “fine” means “no doomsday”, like people starting dying in thousands and unemployment jumping to 50%, then I agree, there won’t be any doomsday. But economy will take two hits, one stronger short-term hit and one weaker long-term hit.
0/0	As a remainer I'm not looking forward to what the future holds
0/0	As a remainer, I accept the result but I would vote remain again. Simply because the EU does not effect my life negativity. I am still yet to hear anyone explain to me why the EU is so bad and how it affects their lives negatively. Yes, I’ve heard all the same sound bites and regurgitated headlines but no explanation of how that is effecting peoples lives directly. Hope it all works out.
0/0	As a resident of the UK, I am so pissed off with this country. The sadist part of me wants everything to be so shit we finally get a proper change in government. I hope this blows up in our face. Maybe I'm a sore loser but I really don't care. I'm ashamed to be a UK resident.
1/1	As a small business owner who believes in British democracy, but mostly as a father #IVotedLeave “I am not afraid of the future.”
0/0	As a spectator on the outside, looking in - and as a US Citizen - I'd argue that the economic costs pale in comparison to the political cost both the UK and the US have suffered as a result of the strong conservative upraise in influence in-both respective nations. We have lost strength of clout and influence on a global scale and neither country is seen as politically stable nor reliable.
0/0	As a strong believer that Brexit is a very damaging mistake that becomes more obvious every day, I see sound democratic reasons for asking the electorate to confirm what it wants to do.
0/0/0/-1/1	As a teenager (who is going to have to deal with the consequences of Brexit but not knowing a thing about what is happening) this video was extremely helpful

0/0	As an American this is incredibly painful to watch...and I feel certain I can speak for large numbers of my fellow countrypersons when I say I am so, SO sorry you guys are having to go thru this.
1/1	As an American, I just hope they can escape article 13, for their own sake.
0/1	As an American, even I can see this is biased. I support Brexit, a country who doesn't want to be part of a collective deserves to be free should the citizens say so, and the citizens have said so.
1/1	As an American, even I can see this is biased. I support Brexit, a country who doesn't want to be part of a collective deserves to be free should the citizens say so, and the citizens have said so. We did it in 1776, you guys are doing it now. Well, you're different, but we're sort of like that. I know a lot of Americans support Brexit, and I hope this follows through.
1/1	As an American, it's good to see our British brethren do what's best for their country and break free from the chains of the EU and globalism.
0/0/0	As an American, the UK leaving the EU has always struck me as stupid and odd because it would be like Michigan trying to leave the United States economy. Why would Michigan ever think that's a good idea for them to cordon themselves off from the rest of the U.S., all in the name of keeping out people from Minnesota and Indiana? Strange and futile, indeed.
0/0	As an Aussie I can’t stop watching these videos. Brexit is like a slow motion car crash that you can’t look away from
0/0	As an EU citizen, I am disappointed that the UK does not want to work together. It's a we want but do not give mentality, where all parties can only lose
0/0	As an European I always looked at the British people and culture with appreciation but when I see the comments and argumentation of the majority of the Brits here I realize how wrong I was. Some are complete imbeciles
0/0/0/0	As an European, i think it is very stupid. Brexit shouldn't happen and they should stay with us.
0/0	As an Irishman I’m really sad that the UK is leaving. Best wishes and you’re always welcome back.
0/0	As an Irishman and a proud European the words Boris Johnston and genuine do not go together. In my opinion it’s all games and showmanship with him and worst he is playing with the Irish peace process and ultimately risking peace and people’s lives.
0/0/0	As an Irishman in the UK I now have more influence and opportunity than a british citizen. I can vote in your elections and live and work anywhere in the EU. What have you gained?
1/1	As an aside, I wonder how many people who voted for remaining were scared into that vote by the economic fear factor that turned out to be pure fiction?
0/0	As an economics student, I can confidently say that almost everything I've read from the leave campaign, at least from a financial standpoint, has been a huge mistake at best, or at worst they are just plain lying to the people. Add on the fact that we will need to keep open borders if we want access to the single market, and I cannot see any reasonable reason to vote leave. I'm not suggesting the remain campaign have behaved entirely reasonably either, but many of their claims have at least some evidence to back them up. Edit: Should've figured this would strike a chord. I'm not claiming to be an expert, just throwing my opinion out there, feel free to disagree. Edit 2: John Oliver has said it better than I can, I encourage you to watch the following video: https://youtu.be/iAgKHSNqxa8

0/0	As far as Johnson is concerned brexit is now all about avoiding scrutiny at any cost
0/0	As if Brexit was an economic vote, give me a break. It was a hate-filled xenophobic vote and that’s it. The older generation would rather see its own kids and grandkids deprived than married to gasp an Eastern European. “They’re not really white, you know.” That’s all it is. The fact that we’ll live worse doesn’t matter to any Brexiter.
0/0	As it goes on so it becomes more frightening. The Brexit debate may reflect the troubles of Europe, but it is also unleashing something far worse. What utter, utter folly.
1/1	As it stands I’m voting to leave, Cameron will have to to come up with something very special for me to change my mind
1/1	As long as Britain leaves the EU Customs Union and Single Market, then it can forge free trade deals with countries around the world

0/0	As much as I think UK is foolish to leave Eu.. they are an independent country .. EU has to make an example out of UK seriously????? Wtf .. EU looks like a butthurt baby ..
1/0	As no deal seems almost inevitable, (I hope), we can take comfort from the billions which have been spent preparing for that very thing, and the thousands of man hours spent on either side of the channel. It will not be as bad as feared. We have survived much worse! Three day weeks, electricity rationing, 27% inflation, Tony Blair, etc!

0/0	As someone from Ireland, I'm terrified for my relatives up in the North. What happened to the Good Friday agreement that was promised? The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
0/0	As someone from OS , the problem is not the EU, it's the laws and set up in this country that essentially discriminates against and fails to protect the lower classes. Simple stuff like being forced to pay the real estate fees and land rates for rental properties, elsewhere the landlord pays for that, it's their property. Pay day loans with extortionate rates, elsewhere these are illegal. Road taxes are high, insurance costs are high; people need a car to work but can't afford to have a car. Fix the basics and empower the poor and the country prospers...but I'm guessing the upper classes wouldn't like that???
1/1	As someone living in the EU, I think EU are being real dicks about this instead of accepting that Britain wants to leave and treating them fairly. It seems the EU is just trying to fuck the British for no other reason than to set an example for other countries who might consider leaving.
0/0	As someone who has worked for the UK government in its economics departments; on paper voting leave is simply ludicrous from a financial point of view. I shall be voting remain.
0/0	As someone who is from the UK, I think we should definitely stay. I know that the EU is not perfect but I know as a fact that leaving wont make it any better for us.
0/-1	As someone who left the country a number of years ago, would I become an illegal immigrant overnight?
1/1/1	As someone who lived a number of years in Europe, including in the U.K., I congratulate Nigel Farage and the Brits on regaining their sovereignty and FREEDOM from the clutches of Brussels. Best wishes to the United Kingdom from TEXAS!
1/-1	As soon as the shekels start pouring in to the local economy, those bourgeois Bremainers will change their tune, mark my word's.
0/0	As the Tories take us out of the EU on the hardest terms, they're risking our jobs, our security and trashing the cooperation of the past 50 years.
1/1	As the UK is justly leaving the anti-democratic EU and is formally in the transition period, the argument to remain is empty. That is, remainers are now an extinct species: You cannot argue to remain in something which we are in the process of formally leaving. Therefore, the tribe which used to identify as remainers has split. The remainers which accept democracy are now leavers and those which do not accept democracy are rejoiners (?), or just malcontents, or something along these lines. Taxonomy is at play.
0/0	As the date of the official political farewell nears (29 March 2019), some activists are talking about halting the process, mainly due to the frozen negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom regarding trade, travel, security, and other areas.
0/0	As they said it's very easy to leave the EU, but what you will do after is the difficult part
1/1	As this glorious event sinks in....it is wonderful to hold our heads up high and pronounce we are a Proud Nation again! Whatever the future holds, it will be a future that is decided by the citizens of this "now again" Great Britain! Our grandparents will be proud!...their legacy is secured!
1/1	As to a British exit from the EU. That cannot come any sooner. The EU experiment is crumbling, borders are being flagrantly disregarded by all and sundry and the leaders of most every country within have little to zero answers to the solution.
0/1	As u/Mintamor has posted, Brexit has economic merits. The weird political situation the EU has (economically one country, politically 27 countries) causes some weird effects that nobody has really encountered in a large scale before and therefore knows how to solve. With that said, the current form of Brexit is entirely stupid. None of the valid issues that some people have raised about membership in the EU have been addressed by the Tory governments, and there is no coherent plan. The UK has decided to leave, but has no clue where it wants to go. The leave campaign decided that in order to win, they can't have any specific plans. While this is true, it also dooms Brexit to being a cluster fuck and all the economic problems of EU membership are more likely to get worse rather than better.
0/0	As was said at the time of the referendum, the people were lied to, inflamed with migrant issues............!!! In consequence we have shot ourselves n the foot!! Don't blame the EU.....the blame lies squarely with the instigators: Cameron-----a woeful decision to call the ref., purely to keep the Tory Party together, Farage, Bojo, Gove, and May and co. for perpetuating the diabolical shambles!!

0/0	As well as this I have lost my identity, not just as a European, but as a Brit
1/1	As you might expect from the Guardian, much of these so-called facts in this study are way out of line and highly tendentious. Even BBC's Newsnight recently reported studies showing that the UK could grow at up to 8% per year if out of the EU. Not a word of it here.
0/0	Ashamed to be British. A country lead by Boris, Farage, Gove and Duncan Smith is not where I belong.
1/1	Ask yourself this question: If it's so great being in the EU, Why would the EU be scared that other countries might follow suit?
1/1/1	Astonishing poll is packed with good news for independence supporters The most important caveat about all of the results
0/0	Astonishing that Leave journos still peddle the myth that there could have been a successful, prosperous Brexit.
1/1	At 11pm tonight, Britain will leave the European Union. After more than three years, we can finally say that we have delivered on the result of the 2016 referendum and have kept faith with the British people.
1/1	At last some sense in Parliament and at last some hard ball tactics from the UK. Now stick to your guns, not deal, no money. Why has it taken 2 1/2 years of total unrest and business insecurity to reach this point. This should have been our position day one.
1/1	At last someone with a backbone! They shouldn't get a penny unless Britain gets what it wants in return. AND we want our fishing waters back too. If they want to make a trade agreement that is purely about tax and customs, fine, but that's absolutely all it should involve. And as for MORE money that the EU are talking about - it should be 3 billion at most and then we want our assets we've paid into returned as well. Time to stop letting them think they can walk all over us!
1/1	At last the road to freedom! Free from packaging regulations! Free from EU flight compensation rules! Free from data protection!

0/0	At no other time would Brexit have happened, either before or after. It was the unfortunate configuration of the arrogant, lazy and cowardly Cameron who called the referendum, Theresa May with an obsession with immigrants and clamping down on them whatever the cost, and a would be socialist, still living the 1968 Student Union bar uprising, who sees capitalist evil everywhere.

0/0	At this point I'm hoping you back out and stay in the EU.
0/1	At this point UK s behavior is insulting to the EU but also irrelevant .Misleading its population is abuse and unacceptable but it’s solely the UKs own responsibility .It’s common sense that all negotiations are over and that the UK has to exit completely by the 19 th of March and there is nothing else to address at all
0/0	At what point has it been a good idea? I seriously think we need another referendum.
1/-1	Atleast we can now see wether or not it is good for the UK to leave once and for all, because then other countries will know from their (UK) experience

1/1	Back to independence 🇬🇧- we should never have joined the EU in the first place.
0/0	Bad
0/0	Bad deal for both. But for the EU, the chaos in the UK is a small blessing disguise. It allowed Barnier and his team to have the upper hand in the negotiations, making the EU look like a united front for once.
0/0/0	Bad for UK end of
0/0	Bad idea
0/0	Bad idea awful execution
0/0	Bad idea.

1/0	Bad things for Britain = Project Fear. Bad things for the EU = Truth.
0/0	Bad. We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services.
1/1	Bank of England Governor admits there are risks to staying in EU. Safer option to #VoteLeave and #TakeControl
0/0	Barclays has just been granted permission to shift 190 billion euro of assets out of the UK. Not sure that was on the side of the bus.
0/0	Barnier rattled the EU's sabre. Johnson twanged the UK's butter knife!
1	Barnier still doesn't get it. It's the EU that needs the trade deal. We can manage without and keep our fishing grounds
1/1	Barnier,Junkner,Tusk three really good reasons to be away from the cesspit called the EU
0/0	Basically Brexit was a big waste of everybody's time
0/0	Basically boris man bad
0/0	Basically brexit is like negotiating for 5 years to move to the house next door which is virtually identical. Utter waste of time.
1/0	Basically our politicians know better than us and are dragging their feet. No deal for the fucking win. Fuck the EU! Yes times will be hard for a while I'm not going to deny that, although I don't think anyone thought we were going to leave and suddenly the economy would shoot through the roof anyway.
1/0	Basically we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit.
1/0	Basically, we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit
0/0	Basically, we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit.
1/0	Basically. The EU has problems there's no doubt. But the misinformation that was spewed by the leave campaign seems to justify a second referendum.
1/1	Be a Churchill Mr. Johnson don't be a Chamberlain..No retreat, no surrender and no backing down to the EU dictatorship!
1/1	Be a sovereign nation or be dictated by some unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. I'd take the 1st part.
0/0	Be brave Mrs May say in sorry but we can’t deliver brexit as it would devastate the country
0/1/0	Be careful. If you remain negative, and then Brexit leads to a terrible outcome for the country, your lack of positivity will be held up as why it went badly!
0/0	Be rational and vote IN
1/1	Bearing in mind that we were deliberately lied to about loss of sovereignty when we joined the then Common Market
1/1	Beati loro! Gongratulation UK! 🇬🇧
1/-1	Beats me how even the most ardent remainers can still support this bloated intransigent dictatorship !
0/0	Because Brexit is objectively a bad idea.
0/0	Because exactly what the UK needs is a smaller group of dickheads with bad ideas who have even less opposition to their bad economics policies. English people you disappoint me
1/-1	Because fuck the voters right?
1/-1	Because fuck your original vote! Now on, let’s do all votes after sufficient propaganda.
0/0/1	Because many multinationals set up in Britain because we offered access to the Single Market. Leave the Single Market, and you take away that reason for these companies to stay.
0	Because naturally clientelism and nepotism are absent or have always been absent of british politics.
1/-1	Because of Brexit people have been engaged in politics in a way they have not before. Please keep us involved - it is our money being spent - we should have a say on major high cost projects - create a new form of politics by including the people you are working for.
0/0	Because over half the U.K. population (including Scotland) are anti-Brexit too - Even in the most recent Prof Curtice’s What UK Thinks Poll of Polls. And the You Gov 26/1/20 poll.
0/1	Because respecting the referendum and the principles of democracy is more important.
0/0	Because stupid people, old people and racists vote too. Same problem in the USA. And Putin laughs.
0	Because the political class is absolutely useless and though we would just sleepwalk into voting remain.
1/1	Because they want to lock us in, we're a cash cow for them and a nation they can dump the Eastern Europeans on.................Lets not forget they've already stated they want to allow 4 more nations in and we know where they'll be heading!
0/0	Because we didn't want you to leave, in the end it would have been so much better for both of us to stay together. ;(
0/-1	Because, even if the political leadership of the UK right now is trying to deny reality, reality will still come crashing down on them on March 29.
1/1	Become independent just like America did
0/0	Been in France for 1 day. Drove 600 miles with no roadworks, everything clean, hotel staff delightful, food perfect, wine incredible, everyone seems to care about their country. We need to be closer, not further away from this amazing place
0/0	Before entering the European Union, UK could not buy even oil
0/1	Before joining EU Britain used to dump all their raw sewage into the sea, of course Britain doesn't want any bindings with the regulations with EU
0/-1	Before the 1980s no one could sell non German beer in Germany, for example, because it didn't comply with their restrictive manufacturing protocol.
0/-1	Before the referendum I argued that if we voted leave we would end up worse off and in a situation where we would have to obey EU laws but have no say in what those laws are
1/1	Before the referendum, the EU wanted Britain to take more refugees. Leaving the EU would allow Britain to regain control of its borders.
0/0	Before the unnecessary referendum we were fine. High employment rates. Free movement. Austerity caused by British government impositions following 2008 global economic crash. Electorate blaming that on EU. Level of ignorance astonishing.
1/1	Before we joined the Conning market our growth was 2.4% we had full employment affordable housing no waiting for doctor's appointments social housing for those who deserved it an NHS coping with demand and we took orders from nobody.....Over 40 years later and 100 Billion Pounds lighter ......Now look at us!
0/-1	Before you vote, just ask this. If we leave, will we have the same freedom to go in to France and destroy the bars of Marseille
0/0	Beginning of the end for the UK...EU membership issue swung a lot of voters in the Scottish Indy Ref.
0/0	Beginning of the fall of the EU, HA! More like the beginning of the fall of the UK
1/0	Being a bit selective with the period of contributions don’t you think? Choosing the best while ignoring the worst is what we might call accounting sleight of hand wouldn’t you say?
1/1	Being an independent nation not ruled by a collective of other countries does have its benefits. UK did well before the EU and I think they'll be ok post EU.
1/1	Being anti EU is not the same as being anti European. Just like being anti Fifa is not the same as being anti football. The EU is corrupt. We are not leaving Europe or the EEA. Just the corrupt EU
1/1	Being in the EU destroys countries by removing their national sovereignty.
0/0	Being in the EU is vital for our generation. So proud that my uni is backing Britain remaining in Europe #StrongerIN
0/0	Being in the EU, Great British startups are entitled to an EU match funded grant. This can bring an additional £250,000 to each startup. After Brexit, we will lose this. Brexit is a disaster for startups!
0/0	Being outward-looking & forming alliances is what makes our city & country so great. #EUref #StrongerIn
0/0	Being poor and voting to leave is like Uncle Tom giving up the fine clothes to go back to picking cotten
0	Being supportive of Brexit is a marker for a wide-range of LESS-EVOLVED ideas, concerns and expectations. Brexit is an anti-intellectual movement. Boris has worked out how to speak to these people. As a young, asian, educated professional Londoner, I feel worried about the future. In fact I am making plans to leave Little Britain....
1/1	Being tied to the same organisation that created the Euro crisis, the migrant crisis, the banking crisis, the mass unemployment crisis & the democratic deficit crisis would be the hight of stupidity.
0/0	Being unified by Europe helped smooth the divisions of history, how can Brexit be anything but a return to division regardless of a hard or soft border?
1/1	Believe in Britain, free, sovereign, democratic, global and strong.
0/1	Believe it or not this Pro EU scaremongering was one of the reasons brexit won..... "constantly bullying the leave voters" and branding them "stupid and racist"
0/0	Believe it when it see it, I just worried about what you are going to give away to get Brexit.
0/-1/0	Believe this is simply taken the amount paid and not the net contribution that would remove the money received back from the EU?
1/1	Belive in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it! #brexitmeansbrexit
1/1	Best day of my life. Finally left the establishment.
1/1	Best decision for democracy, well done Britain, from an Irish person. we all know how EU democracy works here in Ireland, how people quickly forget the Lisbon treaty disgrace
1/1	Best decision in the last 5 decades...bye EU, and hello Europe!
1/-1	Best meat and poultry is British.
1/1	Best thing about this is watching the repulsive BBC-Eurotrash getting more and more upset with each successive result. A roughly six hour trip from smug to distraught that was a joy to behold.
0/0	Best thing education did for me was to make me realize how uneducated I was about a vast majority of things. I don’t want someone as smart as I am to be in charge. I want someone far more intelligent to be in charge. Trump and Johnson seem far less intelligent than I, and I don’t know shit about international politics. I do know shooting ourselves in the economic dick is a bad idea, though.
1/1	Best to vote to leave Britain was a Superpower once remember
1/1	Betrayal, betrayal! No, no one can blame the British for leaving this European Union. A united Europe no longer makes anyone dream. A European Union which has put itself at the service of the global bankster barons, instead of representing the best interests of the Europeans trusting them. The United States, China and Russia use OUR Europe as a puppet, not to say prostitute. They laugh in secret at the incapacity (or corruption?) of our elit€$, because for more than 10 years, these elit€$ have betrayed the interests of us Europeans, by selling our continent to international corporations. They instored crimeocracy, fueled by greedocracy. All these criminal activities skillfully hide an important fact from us, the peoples of Europe: United, under a competent and honest elite, Europe would be THE WORLD SUPERPOWER which would negotiate on an equal terms with the United States, China and Russia and, if necessary, could impose its conditions and standards. Juncker, Merkel, Macron etc. should not be honored, they should be brought before the judge. Europeans, wake up !
1/1/1	Better a brexit now than something worse down the line.
1/1	Better by far to trade with people who love us rather than the people who hate us.
1/1	Better poor than slave! Freedom has no price!
0/0	Better reject the notion of leaving the EU. It's part of Russia plan. Break up the EU, UK and USA.
1	Better to be free and independent rather than part of the collective. Sorry socialists. You've always got venezuela.
1/1	Better to govern thyself that be a slave wariness dried pickles and onions- after so tine pickle taste great and so does onions ....yes the unkonwn is tough and scary but one must remain brave
0/0	Better to stay in the EU dawdling along, annoying the federalists but gaining the benefits of membership until a more evolutionary process brings the EU and UK to a better relationship.
1/1	Between the union and the eu. I choose the union. Not both!! 2nd ref... no change for me. Maybe it's cause the Indy ref only happened before the brexit vote.
0/0	Bexit is a nonsense in a world increasingly dominated by the big boys: the US, China, the EU, and the rising economies of India, Brazil, etc. Any influence that we had was because we were part of the EU. Who will listen to us?
1/0	Bexit problem made by "" uk"""...
1/1	Biased media and fake news. If uk is strong and confident, no need to worry for anything.
1/0	Biased, Balderdash, Contemptuous Remainiacs.
0/0	Big Ben was too expensive so we get an recording with a projector. Says everything about brexit.
1/1	Big Mr Rothschild and his ilk can lord it to us from on high about how we must obey and vote to remain in the EU. The only voice I will listen to is the ordinary man and woman on the street whose wages are being pushed down through competition from migrant workers, and the desperate Steel workers in Port Talbot who are told EU rules prevent us from giving state support to help their industry, etc etc etc etc etc. IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EU. VOTE TO LEAVE - IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR OUR FUTURES!!
0/1/0	Big Win Day for Putin. Democracy on a stretcher/his stooges victorious in America..the E.U., and Britain, weakened for decades by Brexit.
0/0	Big big mistake..
1/0	Big deal The government will get their wish (their wont be a lot of fatty's around ) which will be a big help for the NHS
0/0	Big mistake
0/0	Big mistake!
1/1	Big mouth, zero solutions - calls other exactly what he is. Do you job Nigel, do Brexit. I advise all to look into article 24 on Brexit.
0/0	Biggest mistake UK ever made. Let’s hope a general election reverses the the stupidity
0/0	Biggest mistake the British have made
0/-1	Bigotry and faux victimhood always need a scapegoat
0/1	Billions of pounds going out and millions of invaders coming in ,,,what a crappy deal .
0/-1	Bing bong the environment is gone
1/1	Bit late on this. should have been done 25 years ago, Oh and maybe they should add criminal background
0/0	Black Saturday in UK history
1/0/0	Blame the capitalists for why people want socialism in and migrants out
0/1	Blimey, who are the Brexiteers gonna blame when it all goes wrong....not the EU surely! Hope it all goes well and when do we start getting the £350 million a week! 👍😊
1/1	Blind beliefs to let unelected eurocrats rule over Europe and have unelected EU Commissions make regulations who cannot be ousted by the people is a terrible idea. The new Elite Class of Europe live right there in Brussels with overpaid public service jobs who arrogantly dismissed British concerns and interests for decades. Britain joined the EU decades ago for a trade union, not to give up all national self-governnance and control to eurocrats and 27 other countries. Unprotected borders, letting in dangerous people and unlimited immigration, overburdening schools, hospitals, housing has been a disaster. The excessive EU regulations and being a member of the corporatist, globalist EU has cost Britain billions of pounds per year. Leaving the EU wil save the UK billions of pounds, to make free trade deals with any country in teh world and become great like the free and rich country of Switzerland outside the EU.
0/0/0/0	Bloody Brexiteers don't care if they destroy us all because of their xenophobia :(
0/0/0	Bloody idiots, dont know whats coming
1/1	Bloody love love lovvvve you Boris 🇬🇧🥂🍾🥂🇬🇧
1/-1	Bloomberg lost me at the first point in this article. Anyone citing a steady outpouring of finance jobs from The City needs to check their facts and look up the word trickle.
1/1/1	Blow them out of the water! Rule Brittania!
0/0	Bluntly, the economy will be damaged by people who won’t live to see what they have helped do. That’s just not funny.
0/0	Bo Jo's withdrawal deal is full of holes. Should have been No Deal, clean Brexit.
1/-1	BoJo go to jail, enrol in a de-clowning programme, don't get let out before you've done yr time, but meanwhile allow terrorists out early onto our streets to kill & maim.
0/0	Bojo is a complete fool and will go down as worst prime minister ever and that’s not to mention his unwanted and unwarranted sexual advances towards women. No brexit up Corbin
1/1	Bollocks I cannot wait Come on BREXIT AM NOT PAYING MY MONEY FOR EU ROMANIA IN EU THIS IS CRAZY NO WAY they are the most corrupt country in this planet,how they are in EU??????? Never come on brexit
0/0	Bollocks to Brexit - the real fight starts soon, make sure we are ready
1/1	Bollocks to the EU
1/-1	Boo hoo hoo. Am I supposed to feel sorry for Traitors, sellouts and collaborators now? They cried. So what. They can stay there
1/0	Boohoo so we won’t be able to get the regular “brands” as cheap as we do? Well here we go we can go back to “SEASONAL VEG!” And instead of exporting we can feed ourselves Australia have virtually no food import so they guarantee sales if their own produce!
0/0	Border Protest as Brexit Begins: Brexit does not have the support of the people in Ireland.
1/1	Borders will be more secure with no deal, not less. Bring it on.
1/1	Boris !! for the first time in decades, I am impressed and feel optimistic for the future of a British nation, onwards and upwards, do not take one step backwards. !!!!!
1/1	Boris I am with you
0/0/0	Boris Johnson & the Tories appear to be in the process of ruining our country and economy and continuing to pretend that there will be no problems with Brexit and our country will do wonderfully well outside the EU! Johnson is pursuing a very hard or perhaps even a disastrous No Deal Brexit and this will have major negative consequences for our economy, public services, livelihoods, security etc!
0/0	Boris Johnson going to break up the United Kingdom
0/0	Boris Johnson is a shameful, selfish man who is only interested in himself. Look at his eyes in this clip. He knows he is talking nonsense, but he's doing it anyway because he thinks he can become PM on the back of Brexit hysteria. What a scoundrel.
0	Boris Johnson is a twatt
0/0	Boris Johnson is about to find out just how weak the UK is after Brexit. Britain small. EU massive.
1/1	Boris Johnson is awesome. Although everyday he comes out on TV, his hair looks like he just woke up lol! Congrats on Brexit
0/0	Boris Johnson is so delusional, typical British. It will be fun when you realise you will have to pay us to trade with the most successful trading bloc in the world. Good luck selling your assets to US. It will be super fun to see you crying because everything was privatised. The common uninformed Englishman truly deserves that.
0/0	Boris Johnson is the fourth horseman of the British Apocalypse.✌😁😆☝️
0/0	Boris Johnson sabotaged Theresa May because he wanted her job, and the only way to get it was to push for a total madman's Brexit
1/1/0	Boris Johnson sets out his vision for a trade deal with the EU...... the BBC gets VERY salty.
0/0	Boris Johnson threatens to pull plug on any EU trade deal if it means following Brussels rules
1/1	Boris Johnson won a massive landslide victory in a general election. #GoBrexit
0/0	Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/3 top Brexit parties. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 250K leave-voting unionists. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/4 countries of UK. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by the 53% who voted for 2nd referendum parties. #NotMyBrexit
0/0	Boris Johnson’s Brexit bill has cleared its last hurdle after the government overturned 5 House of Lords amendments, including one restoring the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK.
0/0	Boris Johnsson is a wanker
1/1/1	Boris The Lionheart! Thank you very much PM. Overwhelmingly wonderful.
1/-1	Boris and Nigel are the most respectful pimps ever.. Hope they can save the holy country of England. 🇳🇱 Much love from Holland
0/0	Boris and Raab are just going their usual tub-thumping gaslighting routine. U-turns, re-interpretations, pre-accusations of mal-intent, divide-and-conquer at home and abroad. And pre-conditioning the masses for the blame game. Same old, same old.
0/0/0	Boris and his gang of idiots also seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that because they won an election in the UK with the help of their friends in the press, that they will also be able to do the same thing with negotiations with the EU
1/1	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer!
1/1	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer! That’s because……….. Brexit=Freedom
0/0	Boris doesn't have the competence to be PM for long. Brexit is a disaster, and the UK economy will be damaged for years afterwards.
1/1	Boris got Brexit done...
1/1	Boris has a vision and he's a winner. WTO will do just fine.
1	Boris has achieved, what looks like a great deal for the UK
1/-1	Boris has to show his people that they can be as well off, or better, outside the EU. The EU has to ensure that this is not the case to avoid other states following suit
1/1	Boris has unveiled his canons and fired a distancing shot! Good speech! Determined, clear but cheerful and reasonable, he makes Barnier sound very last century.
0/1	Boris ignoring the fact that people will suffer. That's what a lot of the working class voted for.
1/1/1	Boris is a boss. The British will decide who fishes in their waters. Not the EU.
1/-1	Boris is a secret remainer. He is all for the trade Europe brings. He is just taking advantage of the situation that is why within a week of becoming Prime Minister he called for a General Election.
1/1	Boris is an articulate, jovial, and lovable character who's childhood hero was Sir Winston Churchill, listening to this speech we can see and feel the impact that this great gentleman has had on this young man.
0/0	Boris is at his strongest when he’s waving kippers around to wrongly accuse the EU of creating red tape that originated in the UK.
0/0	Boris is behaving like a dictator. He fancies himself a Churchill, but he's a pale shadow. "Grow up" he says, I say he needs to look in the mirror. The worst PM in British history, a liar even by politician standards who only won an election by lying through his teeth and exploiting a broken system.
1/-1	Boris is going Bald, he is unleashing his potential!
0/0/0	Boris is leading this country into a dark unknow future no deal brexit will lead to mass job loses factory closing down and go to an eu member country to save pay tariff food shortages nhs drug shortages and mass debt on people
1/1	Boris is the messiah who will lead us out of the EU
1/1	Boris may have his faults and has turned his back on N Ireland but Brexit for the UK is the best thing at this stage.
0/0	Boris must knows that we can't have the Butter and the money of the Butter...French proverb. And the EU it's not ONLY a market.
0/0	Boris said Brexit was done. It's not really though is it? And it could go on and on and on and on. Never ending talks no less....
0/1	Boris should spend this year planning for no deal because that's where it is heading.
0/0	Boris still claiming he will get get a great deal with no concessions which is nonsense, he caved in on the WA and hw has nothing to bargain with except fishing. Given how little we actually earn from fishing they should be the first thing on offer and it will really upset that numpty Farage has bonus value.
0/0	Boris the coward didn't even venture outside No 10 last night.
0/0	Boris wants Britain to be "Singapore on the Thames". A one party, authoritarian state. Instead, one generation from now, England will be America's European Puerto Rico, eating genetically modified foods, chlorinated chicken and hormone-laden beef. Then, when they get sick and fat from all their American food products, they’ll have the “freedom” to pay outrageous medical costs in the by then privatized NHS. Freedom in the neo-liberal lexicon means freedom of the strong to predate on the weak. Free Trade is a particular example of this. A rational person must expect the UK to be brutally savaged in dealing with the EU, US and China.
1/1	Boris was brilliant, he was unifying and UK first. Only a biased, prejudice fool is not able to truly listen to the words spoken.
1	Boris will deliver exit. Farage is a amazing political talent, I like him very much. You are the Lucky Brits. My country will never leave, it‘s due to her history: sigh ;).
1/1	Boris will go down along with Churchill as the greatest PM this country has ever had. What a time to be alive. I've had an extra spring in my step these last few days.
1/-1	Boris would be very wise to stick to his promise to UK fisherman. I'm tired people who claim it's an insignificant industry, it certainly wasn't before we gave our waters away. It's time for us to make a stand. Our hard working fishermen have been sold down the river for decades, and I have no doubt if he backs down there's plenty who will want 'to know the reason why'- as they say in Cornwall. And to you fishermen in Scotland, keep a very close eye on a certain woman who will happy shaft you ....
1	Boris you are a breath of fresh air, Patriot of this great nation. we are fully behind you never surrender to the EU.
0/-1/0	Boris' plan is to setup the Brexit for failure, call a general election and campaign on being the person trying to get it done.... but , EU, Parliment, etc were stopping him. Going to fail at that too.
0/0	Boris's Brexit Britain. The UK will be begging for a bailout from the EU within months.
0/0	Boris, how about FREE SPEECH, in Britain!
1/1	Boris. Get it done at the very least 17.4m people onside.
0/1	Boris....right wing... rhetoric...Sir, you're a twit.
1/0	Boris..its not just the leaving of the EU..but..taking decisions like this now..you will be judged on these matters the country is relying on you to get de visions like these right..for our poor fishermen.. and farmers etc,thisis what Brexit is really about..and it starts here and now.
0/0	Borris Johnson said, the UK will not comply by EU standards on social protection or environmental regulations. Well, I guess the UK better get ready for high tariffs and boycotts of its goods and services.
1/1	Borris you got the job done. cheers 🍻
0/0	Botched Brexit followed by a hard left Corbyn government. Just disastrous really.
1/1	Bottom line is many countries are outside the EU and they are doing just fine
1/-1	Bout time
0/0	Brace for the recession, fellas
0/0	Brace yourselves for tough times ahead. Those negotiations will not be easy by any means. The EU will ensure the UK is taught a good lesson so other member states do not dare to follow lead! .
1/1/1	Bravo United kingdom!!!!! You did it, you have your independence back!!!! And your democracy back!!!!!
0/0	Breakfast, not Brexit. Everyone will be happier.
1/0	Breaking news:WERE ALL GONNA DIE
1/1	Breaking up the nation states sounds like a grand idea, but the alternative that presents itself, global governance, seems much, much worse.
0/0	Breixters will be telling us it's all in our heads, after 3 years of evidence and expert opinion on how things are going to go for many years at the least.level 2
0/0	Breixters: The people voted! If we don’t follow through on that vote, democracy is a farce! Remain: We could just vote again now that everyone has more information and many are changing their minds. Wouldn’t that also be democracy? Brexiters: The people have spoken! No take backs!
0/1	Bremainers seem to believe that not a single country on the planet can survive outside of the EU. Obiously not true.
1/1	Bremoaners should be considered as being "Virtue Signalled". Rather like being Stockholmed. A vote for remain was a vote for Dictatorship. I ask Is the Juncker Reich virtuous?
0/0	Bretards won't believe anything.
0/0	Brexcists seem to think that voting for this shit-show will somehow magically insulate them from its effects. Still, I'm sure they'll find a convenient scapegoat to blame for the mess they caused.
0/0	Brexin. Remain is the sane option.
1/-1	Brexit
0/0	Brexit & Trump are like the best and most tragic shows of 2010-2019.
0/0	Brexit (and Trump) happened because around 80% of people are not very intelligent. Winston Churchill:"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." But I don't blame them as much as the scoundrels who promote the brainwashing/ propaganda that feeds the fears of these simpletons. Fox 'news', The Daily Mail, The Sun etc work for the wealthy while scoundrels like Farage, Johnson, Gove, Cummings et al also do their bidding. The fact that so many working class voters see billionaire Trump and Lord (snooty) Rees Mogg as 'one of them' is so pathetic as to be almost funny. Almost. #sad
1/1	Brexit , or death
1/1	Brexit , or death.
0/0	Brexit - A terrible decision.
1/1	Brexit - as good as it gets.
0/0/0	Brexit - something that never should have been put to a referendum. A lose/lose for the UK and the EU. Another foreign policy win for Vladimir Putin.
0/0	Brexit - they thought it was all over! No, that was the easy bit, now the tories face the real test. Can they diverge from EU rules AND get a trade deal? Can they stop border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK? Can they hold the UK together? Can they find the money for HS2? Will Boris lie down in front of the bulldozers at Heathrow or will he just continue lying? Interesting times ahead.
0/0	Brexit 2016 was a chaotic vote, held at the height of lies deliberately perpetuated to misguided gullible , who still believe in the its glory! But it is a titanic that will sank England to a greater depth!!
1/1/1	Brexit <3
0/0	Brexit = Britain has no leverage in trade negotiations. And will be desperate to sign deals. US will firmly demand NHS as part of any deal. Our politicians want your politicians to let our pharma and for-profit health care industries savage your country and grind every last quid out of the British. If you think you can't squeeze blood from a stone then you have never dealt with US health care and pharma industry. I post this everywhere but here goes My 2020 health insurance plan: $21,250 annual premium $5,000 annual deductible $45,000 max annual out of pocket If that sounds great then you will love Brexit. If not, you need to figure out how to cancel Brexit.

1/0	Brexit = The End of the UK
1/1	Brexit = the British Crown/Queen wanting it’s independence back from Brussels... Remain = the Rothschild Euro project/banking system trying to stop anyone from leaving their euro-scam...

1/1/1/1	Brexit ain't broken, we're leaving in March. If we don't then democracy will be broken.
1/0	Brexit allows us to strip away workers rights and regulations
1/1	Brexit allows us to subsidise and nationalise industry

0/0	Brexit biggest mistake in UK history!!
1/1	Brexit by name only. I said it all along!!! I knew what I was voting for. I wanted a hard clean cut. I stand by it more now than I did then
0/0	Brexit can be summed up in 2 words. Complete stupidity.
0/0	Brexit can only go badly. There's nothing in this politics but bad news for anyone. The Leave camp has been thoroughly deceived. Not a single one will get real enough about their project to cost it. So thee is no limit to what it will end up costing us all.
0/0	Brexit cannot happen, if it does, then it will be such a colossal human tragedy. All the families split up. All the businesses shut down. The kids growing up without access to Europe and vice versa.
1/1/1	Brexit could actually be a great opportunity given the massive organizational shifts that are to come globally in the next decade
1/1	Brexit could be a really positive thing, It will allow the 'Europeans' to get on with integrating their countries and creating a new superstate as they clearly want to do.
0/0	Brexit could be the beginning of the end.
1/1	Brexit could bring us more money and less loss.
0/1	Brexit could destabilise the imperial UK establishment and would weaken the imperial EU structure.
0/0	Brexit could have very worse effects on England economy.. :((
0/0	Brexit could potentially lead to the breakup of the UK, an unintended consequence possibly but one that is on the horizon. Northern Ireland is very unhappy with the deal because it creates a customs border with consequences there that could end with them splitting from the UK or violence. The Scottish National party gained a lot of ground in the last election which creates the atmosphere in Scotland for independence
0/0	Brexit could very well lead to the end of the UK, or even of Great Britain.
0/0	Brexit day means nothing except that the people who orchestrated this scam can now line their pockets whilst they negotiate trade deals outside EU. Let's celebrate!
0/0/0	Brexit day showed again there's so much ignorance and racism among Brexit supporters, even though we're told we're not allowed to say that to shut us up. Our job now is to work out how to combat it especially when Brexit and Tory rule will make ordinary people's lives much worse

1	Brexit delayed is Brexit denied. The British government lied.
1/1	Brexit does not translate into leaving NATO, Europe or the EU. Just like Switzerland has close ties to the EU, so will Britain
1/1	Brexit doesn't mean the UK is going to cut it's mooring and drift a thousand miles away into the Atlantic, we're still europeans just not a part of their silly political project.
0	Brexit doesn't seem very well thought though.
1/1	Brexit doesn’t need fixing. We voted Leave. No Deal would be fantastic for the UK. All that is stopping it are treasonous politicians who do not want to obey the will of the electorate. Either we leave on schedule and get what we voted for or democracy is dead.
1/1	Brexit ensures that the money the UK previously sent to Brussels will be spent as the UK decides.
1/1	Brexit establishes the sovereignty of Britain.

0/0	Brexit good for the EU? Right, sure, say what you like
0/0	Brexit guaranteed to be a calamity
1/1	Brexit had better go ahead unless they want a riot
1/1	Brexit happened because of uncontrolled migration over forty years which changed the country beyond recognition and alienated the majority of older working and lower-middle class white voters whose votes tipped the balance in favour of leaving the EU. Pretending otherwise is now a niche industry for centre-left spin doctors in training.
1/1	Brexit happened because the E.U. treated the U.K. worse than a foe conquered in military conflict. They charge us a fee for trading, just like the Mafia changed businesses, they stole our fisheries, putting thousands out of work, they forced immigration upon us, compelling us to financially support families in other countries who would never live here. ONLY enemies usurp a country's sovereignty in this way. TRADING PARTNERS never do this. The E.U. is a criminal enemy to the U.K. and it is high time that this was recognised by our politicians, and they are treated as such. We owe them nothing. They owe us £billions for the years they have mistreated us. Bankers, businesses and Socialists, those who benefit from the E.U. at the expense of our people should hang their heads in shame for not supporting our country!
1/1	Brexit happened because years of complaints from British governments from both parties that the union was obsessed with integration etc were completely ignored. It used to be a great little trading club but then started to get involved with things that were nothing to do with trade. We complained for years and were ignored. So guess what? We left.
0/1/0	Brexit has a good chance of breaking up the uk.
0/0	Brexit has a new meaning, it now means........ LEAVE BRITAIN, LEAVE THE UK.
0/0	Brexit has actually been a quite good advertisement for the benefits of the EU.
0/0	Brexit has allowed the UK to be almost entirely governed by the right wing parties. I have never been more ashamed to be British in my entire life. Now Scotland and Northern Ireland must show defiance to where the UK is going and leave before we have a Trump like character running our country too.
0/1	Brexit has already cost the U.K. more than its EU budget payments.
1/1	Brexit has already created a new industry. Remainer salt mines! We need to get exporting that sweet sweet salt.
0/0	Brexit has already made Britain poorer, weaker and meaner
0/0	Brexit has become a tale of woe, capital flight of the order of 800 billion Euros has left the UK because of Brexit.
0/0	Brexit has been a disaster for the UK, France and Spain. It is a dream that will become a nightmare for other member states as the wealthy states begin to remove their support.
0/0	Brexit has been about nothing but the Tories putting their own electoral survival ahead of the interests of the country.'Getting Brexit done' was just a euphemism for 'keeping the Tories in power' and if that means throwing the country under the bus then so be it.
0/0	Brexit has been initiated. This is a sad day for Europe, for The European Union and above all, for The United Kingdom.
0/0	Brexit has been lies from start to finish. But you know what? Let's have Brexit. On 1 condition: OWN IT. Stop blaming EVERYONE else, stop blaming the EU. This was going to be the best & easiest thing ever. OWN IT.
0/0	Brexit has completely reset the U.K.s image and reputation. Now it is bracketed with Kaschinski's Poland and Orban's Hungary as a country taken over by narrow minded bigotry, nationalism and xenophobia pandered to by a new government to that is a mixture of chancers and ideologues leading it into penury and isolation.
0/0	Brexit has defined the death of colombia, and that will bring horrible problems to uk.
0/0/1	Brexit has done the rest of the EU countries a great favour. It’s such a self-evidently stupid move to make that it’s killed off all the similar right-wing ’exit’ policies across the EU. Here in Sweden the only two political parties who had ’Swexit’ as part of their programmes quietly dropped the idea about 2 years ago.
0/0	Brexit has enabled and normalised racism and xenophobia and the worms have crawled out from under their rock .
0/0	Brexit has made Brits `angrier' and `deeply divided'
0/0/0	Brexit has made me ashamed of my country.
0/0	Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine
0	Brexit has never been a fundamentally awful idea... but the way it’s been handled and the people who have been negotiating have been nothing short of catastrophic
0/0	Brexit has never been about Britain first. It's always been about a small grain of shady business people first. If anything was Britain first it would be staying in the EU.
0/0	Brexit has never been advocated by what it would give to average Britons, but rather by what it would take from the "others" like the EU, eastern Europeans, and "brown people".
0/0	Brexit has no worthy objectives and no likely positive outcomes
0/0	Brexit has proven to destabilizing. The right wing is cancer not only here in america but to all nations around the world

0/0	Brexit has suckered millions of people into a situation where: -a UK government has wasted £130bn - enough to DOUBLE
0	Brexit has taught me that a lot of people who apparently went to the 'school of life' and the 'university of hard knocks' think they are just as capable of understanding the economic and trading complexities of Brexit as those who went to real universities to study those things.
0/0	Brexit has to be painful. Maybe then the UK will learn and rejoin. Leavers got what they wanted, it sucked and now is time to go back begging to the EU
0/0	Brexit has turned into an absolute disaster.. We are the laughing stock of the World!
0/0	Brexit hasn't even happened yet, and it's already a disaster
1/1	Brexit helped us get rid of the rules set by Brussels, some of which even overturned British law.
0/0	Brexit in UK, Trump in America, AfG in Germany, The League in Italy, Front National in France, DPP in Denmark, Democrats in Sweden, Freedon Party in Austria and Netherlands. Are these Alt-Right movements the beginning of the end of Western Civilization as we know it?
0/0	Brexit in any form is going to mean job losses, recession and inflation it's just a matter of how many , how long and how much. We're leaving something we've been in for 40+ years , millions of people have moved countries, thousands of businesses have set up trade links, combined research, agencies,............. If you don't think this isn't going to cost you're not thinking.
1/1	Brexit is Brexit. No Deal Hard Brexit is what the people of UK voted for and UK Parliament has to deliver. Just get on with it and sort it out.
1/1	Brexit is Brexit.. YEAHH WERE OUT! GLORY TO UK!
0/0	Brexit is British pride and arrogance.
0/1	Brexit is Dead ... the hatefest is over!
0/0	Brexit is Putin's dream come true - he wants to destroy all of the western countries and alliances.
0/0/0	Brexit is a Trumpian move. Instead of working out a solution that does not isolate the country as a whole. Brexiters should know that Britain is no longer an empire thus it needs allies.
0/0	Brexit is a bad idea. 'No deal' Brexit is lunacy.
0/0	Brexit is a bad idea. Sometimes I hope a hard brexit will happen so that people will actually understand that it does more harm than good, then sometimes I hope it just doesn’t happen at all.
0/0	Brexit is a cancer not a plague. No one is going to delay food and medicines entering the country. On Brexit fools day the gutter press would be full of pictures of well, normality under "Project Fear" headlines. Over the following days and months Project reality would start to kick in. For example the government would have to choose between 40% price increase on imported food or unlimited free trade with the whole world. It is difficult to see the Government choosing 40% food price increases so imports from the rest of the world would increase and prices of food imported from the rest of the world would go down. Without massive government subsidies British farmers would become bankrupt and we would become totally dependent on food imports from the rest of the world. I take no comfort from the fact that British farmers were more strongly in favour of Brexit than the rest of the country. No Brexit is the only good Brexit. Most people, electors, farmers, car workers and Parliamentarians wish to stay in the EU. Let’s take back control, save a couple of billion a week and send the Letter of Revocation.
0/0	Brexit is a cancer, not the plague. The UK economy will not implode on 30th march. It starts slow, with lower investments and new businesses who would have choosen the UK, but will chose now one of the EU27 to build a business in europe.
0/0/0	Brexit is a catastrophy. Britain has re-achieved its "little island floating in the sea near Europe" status. No thanks to the little no-brainers who voted for it.
1/1/1	Brexit is a certainty. I voted ‘Leave’ and the government promised to implement that decision.
1/1/1	Brexit is a chance for British people to make a correction to everything - democratic, economic,social corrections,
0/0	Brexit is a comedy. UK will never decide to exit EU. It will mean more misery than staying in the EU. Europe will wither with EU. EU's bureaucrats will ruin Europe. UK won't stop it.
0/0	Brexit is a complete disaster! The most ridicules referendum ever
0/0	Brexit is a con which takes rights, protections and freedoms away from the British public and offers them nothing in return. We all deserve better.
0/0	Brexit is a crime scene. To come together is to accept that. No thanks. You own this. You also own all the chickens that will now come home to roost.
0/1	Brexit is a cult. Just based on faith, xenophobia and jingoism.
0/0	Brexit is a death sentence to the party that sees it through.
0/0	Brexit is a death spiral led by people so deluded they behave like extremists. A rational government would have done the risk analysis before triggering Article 50 and concluded that a soft Brexit, Norway model would have been the sensible course to take. I can't face a life supporting a country that has elected to get poorer over the next decade. I don't want to have children growing up and paying for Brexiteers mistakes. I think we should all think very seriously about getting out while we can.
0/0	Brexit is a delusion, before it really becomes effective you will have economic melt down in the UK and then you will see the clueless politicians May and Corbin running like headless chickens
0/0	Brexit is a disaster for Britain and a small setback for the rest of EU.. in a nut shell
0/0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well. We live in a globally connected world now and those most able to adjust and play the game win. You can’t insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore. UK will realize this the hard way.
0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK but it's what the people voted for. And even if they didn't know what they were voting for how can that vote be set aside. But really, truly leaving the EU is really, truly damaging.
0/0	Brexit is a disaster, Italy won't be real about its debt, and the European Union is in trouble.
0/0	Brexit is a disaster. All you're arguing about is different levels of disaster! If only there was a way to avoid this Brexit disaster? Such as stopping Brexit? It's not impossible to avoid this disaster, is it?
0/0	Brexit is a disaster. Stay in the union. Hold another vote before a hard Brexit. Do not be stupid you pack of old lards.
0/0	Brexit is a disgusting series of lies at every turn. Admittedly the lies led to a one percent majority in an advisory referendum. But from the money for the NHS to the easiest negotiations in history, this hi-jacking of democracy is just that.

0/0	Brexit is a dumb move. Sure, why not leave one if the worlds biggest trading blocs! I’m sure NOTHING could go wrong. Scotland’s got the right idea in trying to leave the uk.
0/0	Brexit is a failed idea from its core. People supporting it are basically supporting there own countries downfall because they are that scared of immigration.
0/0	Brexit is a fiasco of epic proportions, however many other countries are also unhappy with the with way the EU is run by Brussels. Forget Brexit it’s never going work, forget Remain it just wrong for our nation. We should get together with other member states and push for EU REFORM.

0/0/0	Brexit is a scam and a massive mistake. That I always thought was a terrible idea and holding a referendum on it wasn’t a good idea.I see no tangible benefits with plenty of downsides to it. I firmly believe that the best place for the UK is being a committed member at the heart of the EU and it is a shame that so many British people fail to see that.
0/0	Brexit is a scam, a coup against democracy. In five years when the coffin dodgers who voted Boris Brexit are dead there will be restorative justice. Retribution. And we will join Schengen and the Euro.
0/0	Brexit is a scam, pure and simple. Good for elite toffs as they believe it misleads the ultra foolish.

Of course, a few disaster capitalists will get very rich. Must be rubbing their hands at the prospect of slashing workers rights, health and safety and environmental standards.

0/0/0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster and I loathe and detest Cameron’s lazy, incompetent, irresponsible and ignorant approach to the referendum
0/0/0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK.
0/0/0/0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK. During the past 45 years within Europe we have increased our prosperity, security and vibrancy as a nation state. London has become the Capital of Europe, The Big Apple of the EU in much the same way New York is for the rest of the USA. I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out. Demographically these people were older, less well educated, less economically active and from the racist and bigoted elements of our population. Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades. These people will suffer first and most as the jobs go. The jobs are going already. We just lost an airline (Monarch) with 2100 jobs because of Brexit uncertainty. Banking job movements to other countries have already started. Dozens of companies planning to move operations to the UK have cancelled the plans. Finally, the real reason that many UK citizens voted for Brexit was racist. There was a belief that too many foreigners were coming to the UK. This belief was most common with the elderly, the uneducated and the ignorant. It was a nasty and racist and pointless backlash against all the economically mobile, hardworking and useful people who were coming the UK and who have kept our economy warm since the financial crisis. This is an unprecedented case of the population of a major economic power being allowed to grab hold of the rudder and then steering the whole lot of us onto the rocks to sink. What a load of Bollocks. STOP BREXIT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Brexit is an utter and complete failure either way. At best it'll be miserable. When will these dilettantes and con artists held responsible for this utter mess they created in the UK, costing the UK tax payer many billions already with absolutely nothing to show for it. The exodus of high caliber business is accelerating.
0/1	Brexit is and always will be, the best thing that Britain has ever done for itself. It’s a victory for the British people.
0/0/0/0/0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
0/0	Brexit is another worrisome sign of the European drift towards right-wing ideologies spread by demagogues taking advantage of the bad economic situation of many.
0/0	Brexit is as bigoted as “the wall” chatter here, and I’m sorry you’re citizens have to endure it as it’s not “growing pains” but shrinking your access to the rest of Europe. I just cannot see that as a good thing. The new taxes and passport mess, pretending this will keep “foreigners” out... the job losses, down swing of the economy.
1/1	Brexit is awesome.
0/0	Brexit is bad for PR and development. Nobody wants to study or move to a greatly diminished Britain. US universities will happily outcompete UK unis for those students.
0/0/0	Brexit is bad for the UK and Europe
0/0	Brexit is bad your country. And with Britain being our Papa. us Americans feel bad for our paps. Really though, we couldn’t care less as it doesn’t effect us.

0/0	Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked your food
0/0	Brexit is becoming a national joke. No longer the "will of the people", with Beregret increasing day by day, we are laughing at the mess that Tories are making of it or we would be if it wasn't fucking the country. Brexit is bad for Britain.
1/-1	Brexit is beloved by the poorly educated at the bottom and beloved by their arch manipulators, the people at the top.
0/0	Brexit is beyond criminal. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are criminals. They will go down in infamy.
1/1	Brexit is bigger than the Conservative Party. Brexit is bigger than all the British political parties put together so Britain has to do whatever it takes to get a proper Brexit (Hard Brexit).
0/0	Brexit is boring. It and Donald Trump are horrible and pretending there is any nuance left more than that is a waste of time. If the audience can write the same political jokes as you, you don’t belong on stage.
0/0	Brexit is breaking Britain. We must vote down May's deal.
0/0	Brexit is built on lies and cheating. It’s time to #StopBrexit.
0/0	Brexit is bullSH/T-sold to the general public by RICH liars,supported by the easily conned& promoted by the establishment loving media -name me one Tory policy that’s helped anyone in Austerity UK !?Homelessness/poverty/ austerity deaths on the rise while the Rich get tax breaks
0/0	Brexit is causing me short term anxiety and long term depression. To the extent that I have lost sleep pondering political and economic scenarios. Scenarios which could lead to my government increasing or abusing powers, a decline in the standard of my food purchases, stagnant living standards, compromised employment protection and reduced residency rights in other EU countries.
0/0	Brexit is developing into a project where there will be unpalatable comprises, painful trade-offs and potentially irresponsible political decisions with profound economic consequences.
0/0/-1	Brexit is done and so is the country
1/1	Brexit is done. Celebrate. The world has become a better place. What a great atmosphere in Parliament Square...brilliant.
0/0	Brexit is driven by people with nothing to lose. Those who are cripplingly poor and want change and those who are rich seeking to get richer. You don't need Paddy Power to work out the odds of who will really benefit.
0/0	Brexit is economic suicide for the UK.
0/0	Brexit is evil putins project. Feminists and lgbtq must spearhead the fight against putin
0/0	Brexit is fascism. Whenever people say such statements are exagerated, they're complicit. How bad is bad enough for the English to be able to face their own mess? Where do the English draw the line, gas chambers? Fascism does not require the existence of gas chambers, it's nevertheless still fascism. English nationalism is extremism. Brexit is embryonic fascism. It should've been recognized as such and aborted long ago. It has now metastasized and the English and their cowardnes are responsabile.
0/0	Brexit is finished. We the people have spoken. We shall remain.
1/1/1	Brexit is for the British , live with it.
1/1	Brexit is for the best. Brits give more money to the EU than the EU gives back. Until Brits have left the EU they cannot have control over their borders. The trade will be fine as everyone else will leave the EU as well and trade will continue as normal.
0/0/0	Brexit is for the richest in our country: they can afford recessions.
1/1	Brexit is freedom. Brexit is getting out of an un-democratic container called the EU. The EU is a flawed, corrupt, undemocratic construct. Yanis Varoufakis (The Greek Finance minister, and intellectual, who resigned a few years ago) says so. He does say that it needs to be reformed from the inside out and does not advocate a Brexit. But from a practical standpoint, the EU is not reformable.
0/0	Brexit is fueled mainly by ignorance, bigotry and xenophobia. I haven't heard one cogent economic argument for it. Just one would be enough to consider it. But nope, not even one.
1/1	Brexit is giving the EU's remaining members a good reason to stick together
0/0	Brexit is going to be a total disaster, why are we doing this?
1/1	Brexit is going to mean the UK is open for wonderful trade deals that the rest of the world will be queuing up for.

0/0	Brexit is just a big pile of shit, can we just cancel this disastrous mess. 2 and a half years for this.
1/1	Brexit is just a country governing itself, just like America Japan and New Zealand. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no hard or soft Brexit, just Brexit which will be a huge success long term.
0/0/0	Brexit is just a sideshow for what is really going on here.
0	Brexit is just idiotic. I can't believe the government allowed uneducated people to vote on such an important issue in the first place. Now they'll have to face the consequences and end up being an underdeveloped country in 50 years
1/1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically.
1/1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically. For instance, most people in northern Europe see southern Europe as a place to go to play, not to do business and partner. Then there was Merkel's boneheaded decision to let immigrants in, no questions asked. Finally, there was the time-frame: people on both sides of the Pond believe that their governments have forgotten the citizens for whom they work. The cure for all three of those problems is to throw the b**tards out. Brexit is just the leading edge of what lies ahead. In the meantime, let us remember Maggie Thatcher's wise words from September 1986: "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose. But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country; for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries." I wish she were still with us. She and Reagan made a huge difference in the world. It is too-too bad--and sad--that there are no comparable leaders on the world scene today.
0/0	Brexit is laborious, time consuming and (at times) all consuming.
0/0	Brexit is like England going into a football tournament arrogantly thinking they are going to win it. The English get far too optimistic in the build up and then they get taken down with a bang and start girning.
1/1	Brexit is like Moving House or Changing Jobs, or moving to a different part of the country where you have to meet new friends & find your way around the streets etc. Awkward at first but very soon you get used to it.
0/0	Brexit is like cigarettes. It will damage our health.
0/0	Brexit is like fools gold to all of you Brexiteers.Brexit will cost way more than it is worth too all of you Brexiteers.
1/1/1	Brexit is like going on a rollercoaster for the very first time. Exciting and a bit scary. It's one hell of a ride but afterwards you are so glad you did it.
0/0	Brexit is like having a few complaints about your house so you burn it to the ground and then start thinking about how you might want to rebuild it
0/0	Brexit is like not caring about which lavatory pan we are flushed down as long as it is the Uk that pulls the chain.

0/0	Brexit is not ideal.
0/0	Brexit is not quite as good as wartime Britain, in a war output has to increase. Our firms relocating abroad. and those that are staying here shutting down, or closing stores, in not the same thing. The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.
0/0	Brexit is not the will of the British people - it never has been
0/0	Brexit is not the will of the people in the UK. It never has been

0/0	Brexit is shit, more trouble than it's worth, was based on lies, and overall just creates an atmosphere of shitness across england
1/1	Brexit is simple and harmless.
1/1	Brexit is simple and harmless. It’s a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer’s no. It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren’t in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
1/1	Brexit is simply a return to national self government as broadly understood to apply to the vast majority of countries which are not members of the European Union.  It is astonishing that we ever abrogated this privilege and even more astonishing that so many of those who aspire to govern us have absolutely no faith in the country whatsoever.
1/1	Brexit is so important, it gives us our freedom back.

Beware! Brexit will dissolve the union and the rest of it will regret this action for decades..

0/0	Brexit is the biggest disaster the British people have faced since the second world war... If we leave the EU it will bring hardships on a scale that will make the 2007 recession look like a rainy Sunday afternoon. People voted for brexit based on feelings, not with their heads. And as a protest vote against the government. I can only hope that some common sense will prevail before we all pay the price for it at the end of March.
0/0	Brexit is the biggest hit to Britain's status on the world stage since the Suez crisis. It's an act of cultural and economic suicide that is only going to make us poorer and nastier in the short and the long term.

0/-1	Brexit is the other face of the refugee crisis - tensions that lead to stasis, external risks that lead to asymmetric shocks.
0/0	Brexit is the poisoned chalice given to the younger generations by the older. One can analyse the ins and outs of it and see how much the globalization the immigration hence the loss of national identity and the fears thereof contributed to it all. But in the end Brexit is what the UK has today and it will decide the shape of the country for generations to come. For better or worse this is it! Not a cat in hell chance of going back from here.

0/0/0/0	Brexit is the single biggest misstep in British history, brought about by self-seeing charlatans, and voted in by sheep.

1/1	Brexit is the will of the people
0/0	Brexit is the worst political decision Britain will ever make, Britain just became worse off and the people who voted for Brexit will be the first to complain when they have less money and less standard of life. Lucky me I have 3 nationalities two being German and English.
0/0	Brexit is the wrong move for our future, things will get needlessly complicated and it's time wasting. Most of the leave voters were old miserable smurfs in the 65+ age group, their future is as strong anyway. After the referendum, the most searched thing on Google was 'What is The EU?'. I think that just says it all. Not to mention our government is going in the direction of Somalia.

0/0	Brexit itself is mad. A “no-deal” Brexit is suicidal.
0/0/0	Brexit itself is staggeringly likely to cripple the economy and has created a huge divide already in the country. Adding Scottish independence into the mix will almost certainly destabilise the economy even more and, if independence is sought after, politically split the country in two. In that sense, it would be incredibly destructive for the current government to risk that.

0/0	Brexit makes me want to poke needles into my eyes
0/0	Brexit makes no sense and Britain should vote again
0/0	Brexit makes the UK a small, isolated, insular place with reduced influence. That must attract certain elements of the Republican Party.
1	Brexit makes us a fully autonomous nation free of EU regulations and EU parliamentary decisions. Ensuring that when we vote for a law it can't be overturned by EU parliament. We're ensuring that we remain free of an EU super-state that aims to control everyone. We aim to keep free of a failing currency and economy and we are returning to our former glory of a nation that demands respect not laughed at and controlled by Brussels. We are ensuring that comrade Corbyn can't give our nation away.
1/1	Brexit marks the beginning of the end of the EU. A great day!

0/0	Brexit pays for the few while destroying the lives of the many.
0/0	Brexit pretty much is the only international news we've been getting besides Ukrain/Russia and the Australian wildfires. From what I've heard it seems like it wasn't the best decision, and the process leading to the actual exit was a big clustefuck.
0/0	Brexit propaganda is just that: propaganda. There is very little truth in any of it. It is not even particularly good propaganda. As to why anybody would believe anything that Boris the Liar says, that is completely beyond me. Ho-hum, some people are about to learn who is big and strong and tough, and who is little and weak and not so tough.
0/1	Brexit really reminds me of the story about Congo's independence. They all cheered because they would be free.
1/1	Brexit red lines are constantly being broken. No compromise. We leave end of March with a deal or without a deal. They have had two years!
0/0	Brexit removes our rights. Brings us new taxes. Tangles us in new bureaucracy. Brexit is a massive lie. There are precisely no benefits. Just drawbacks.

0/0/0	Brexit was a disaster from the beginning. It started with lies told about the EU, Farage even apologized for the lies.

0/0/0/0	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
1/1	Brexit was a good idea.
0/0	Brexit was a hatred vote. Hatred of immigrants, foreigners, the EU and Muslims. No good can ever come of such negativity and Britain will sadly pay a terrible collective price unless it changes its mind.

0/0	Brexit was always a mistake from the first. Europe is stronger united.
0	Brexit was always going to be death by a thousand cuts. Not just the deceitful ones that come naturally to Boris and his cabinet, but by businesses pulling away from the UK, by talent - especially in the NHS - removing itself from the country for good, but the EU will stand firm as a massive trading block on behalf of its member states.
1/1	Brexit was an excercise in the wise (older voters) rescuing the young (brainwashed) voters from themselves.
0/0	Brexit was and continues to be a disaster and funny enough, the main culprits (boris johnson and that snake farage) are oddly yet not surprisingly no where to be found.
0/0/0/0	Brexit was and is on Putin's agenda. Stop it NOW.
0/0	Brexit was and still is the stupidest thing that the UK has done. It is likely the Scottish will leave and that Ireland will re-Unify. That is the only reasons to MAYBE be ok with Brexit.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Brexit was based on fear. Fear of the other. It was not a rational decision but a reactionary one. It was bad for Britain and it is bad for the residents of the Commonwealth. The only beneficiary of the Brexit was Russia.
0/0	Brexit was driven by British delusions of grandeur: "re-assert the Comenwealth" as if Canada & Australia wanted to be asserted against like its 1910...strike beneficial trade deals with the USA & China when the EU couldn't..."Global Britain" at the heart of world trade...Yet the reason the UK needed to leave was that poor little Britain was getting bullied by the evil Germans & French...If the UK could not assert itself agains Paris & Berlin inside of the block, how will the UK assert itself against France & Germany backed by Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the rest of the 27???
1/1	Brexit was heaven sent, a mirror revealing the hideous State of the Nation for all to see. The Establishment’s relationship with the people is an abusive one. With unsound money and measure every communication is dishonest; the public must be deceived for the confidence scheme of created debts to continue unabated. Some even consume bbc state propaganda and expect the truth. Parliament’s primary objective is to distract the unthinking and bury the real issues under a pile of deceit. You see, claiming the Crown operates a system of free market capitalism doesn’t survive close scrutiny. Capitalism only works in conjunction with sound money and measure. Capitalism with an unsound currency, like today’s pyramid scheme of banker’s debt, quickly descends into Kleptocracy, where markets get rigged and rapid debasement creates rampant structural inequalities, both within and across generations, without the chance of salvation. The ruling elite are unfit for purpose and the case for breaking up this cosy little club grows stronger every day. They cannot be trusted, they’re incapable of change, and they’re committed like a cult. Their source of power must be scattered to the four winds. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, unite against the darkness of Westminster and like a light onto the world we shall restore sound money, for the benefit of all, not just the corrupt few.
1/1	Brexit was heaven sent,...." Agreed. As while it shines a light on our Europhile establishment, it shines a much larger one on the EU, its aims and methods. Brexiteers couldn't have done a better job persuading many that voted Remain that they were wrong to do so, than the lesson learned by the Brussels strong arming of UK interests. Far many more want us 'to get on with it' than around the referendum time. No going back now, ever.
0/0/0/0	Brexit was like the UK got drunk and accidentally unfriended Europe on Facebook
1/-1	Brexit was never simply about trade because the EU isn't simply about trade!
1/-1	Brexit was never simply about trade; for many it is a matter of principle
0/-1	Brexit was not about having a plan, it only ever appealed to enough people by being impossible. Lets hope the ruin of the UK is enough for these idiots.
0/0/0	Brexit was ruined from the start, they never intended on actually doing it.
0/0	Brexit was sold as having all the benefits of EU Membership without any of the legal, regulatory, or financial responsibilities. People directly funded by Russian Intelligence, (who view the EU and NATO as a threat) lied to the British people promising Brexit meant a free ride.
0/0	Brexit was stupid.

0/0	Brexit was the biggest con in British history....
0/0	Brexit was the biggest mistake of Uk.
0/0	Brexit was the dream of a few tax-avoiding millionaires with powerful allies in the media. There has not been a single provable benefit except for those who can avoid the forthcoming EU tax-avoidance directive. Millions of our electorate have been whipped up into a populist frenzy believing that somehow the EU is the enemy when in reality they have been used as puppets of the elite. Sad.

1/0	Brexit was won because of years of lies and anti EU propaganda from right wing UK newspapers and media.
0/0	Brexit wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
1/1	Brexit wasn't about deals it was about leaving END OF
0/0	Brexit wasn't properly discussed and the vote was done in impulse. The margin of 51.9 to 48.1 reflects the unsureness of some of the electorate. Lack of education, discussion, impulsiveness of the topic led to an ignorant vote.
1/0	Brexit wasn't that bad of an idea if it wasn't being negotiated by these monkey.
0/0	Brexit wasnt a rational argument for something, it was an emotional argument against something perceived as bad.
0/0	Brexit will address nothing. Sort out immigration? Everyone I know on FB wasn't posting about anti EU immigration, they were posting about them Muslims or Asian refugees/ migrants coming into Europe. All Brexiters have is their old man xenophobia.. The whole project of Brexit is to make a small group of billionaires more wealthy with less accountability..
0/0	Brexit will affect UK economy.
0/0	Brexit will also bring another scottish referendum.

1/1	Brexit will be a catharsis.
0/0/0	Brexit will be a disaster.

0/0	Brexit will destroy the EU. More will follow! :D
0/0	Brexit will do most harm to the regions especially the North and the poorer more remote regions of the UK. We don't need to leave the EU to decentralise Britain. Very much the opposite in fact. For the last few decades the EU has been the only government body attempting to improve the north of England, while Westminster did nothing. Brexit is in reality a suicide note from the poor.
0/0	Brexit will end London's financial dominance.
1/1	Brexit will happen, Brexit must happen. All the negative talk around Brexit is just fear monger appropriated by the EU. The EU NEEDS Brexit to fail in order to maintain civility amongst itself.

0/0/0	Brexit will possibly even take the UK back to our standing before we were in the EU (which of course would be an absolute disaster - we joined because the country was quite literally failing)
0/0	Brexit will probably not "End" well for it came about based on LIES and ignorance much as the election of Trump in USA. Imagine that Brexit will increase the demands of Scotland, N. Ireland and maybe Wales for independence to varying degrees. Of course, there were complaints concerning the E.U. but think Winston Churchill said it was better to be in the tent than outside pixxing in, or something like that!
0/0	Brexit will probably ruin the economy
0/0	Brexit will reduce the care and social backup that people need. Those with money will go to Poland for teeth, France for cancer, choose your Euro destination based on ailment, Switzerland for end of life services.

Yeah, I used to think that was a joke. Then Brexit. Then Trump. Nope. It's not a joke anymore.
1/1	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure.

0/0	Brexiters make me laugh...They want a good deal for them, ( UK deals) but no to respect the EU deals and ageements. Morons.
0	Brexiters often try to oversimplify the economics of trade in order to maintain the fiction that buccaneering Britain can forge its own way in the world independent of the great trading blocks of China, the US and the EU. And of course they cite prosperous independent countries that are not in the thrall of any of them. Switzerland, Japan and South Korea are often mentioned. The devil is, as always, in the detail and one big detail is the fact that British industry has for over 40 years been busy integrating with Europe. Readjusting to life outside will be painful. Businesses will go bust and others will have to make painful changes. Of course knowing what changes are required would help but we are still in the dark on that one. When we look at how other smaller economies go it alone brexiters need to consider how they do it. Some in Asia have working practices and employment rights that no European would ever accept. There would be riots in the streets - even in supine Britain. We are not going to become South Korea or Malaysia. Other countries are small and specialise - we could do that but again the transition would be painful. In order to keep our mixed economy afloat and particularly the services sector Britain needs trade deals with many countries. Doing deals with countries smaller than we are should be relatively straightforward but we cannot survive without the big three. With them we are very weak. We no longer have the heft of the EU behind us and we will be bullied by all three of them.
0/0	Brexiters say " Don't call us thick or stupid". Cool , can you tell us any benefits of brexit , what problems in your life will be solved by leaving the EU ? fuck off remoaner , we won get over it , 17.4 million , you lost ,that's democracy etc Conclusion - Thick as pigshit

1/1	Brilliant Boris, all this under funding etc has been while we have been in Europe, we have given them a fair chance to help us but we don't prosper under EU Influence, we are an island that is bigger than just its size ,leave now,make us GREAT Britain
1/1	Brilliant article! I like in particular how you make reference to, and describe, those people and institutions that tried so hard to thwart Brexit and failed miserably. Why should we ever take these people or institutions seriously again. I really admire the grit, steel and determination of Boris Johnson, the influence and far reaching strategic vision of Dominic Cummings and the ERG for their constant pressure on people like May. Oh, and let’s not forget the crucial part that Nigel Farage has played in all of this, without his lifetime fight to exit the EU we would not be where we are today.

1/1	Britain and America are God’s children. Britain is finally free.
1/1	Britain and Germany have been propping up the EU. The premise of the EU was to make it easy for a lot of countries to share money... loans and payback... to help with projects that would build up Europe as a whole and make it all come out ahead. The problem arose when money was lent to places like Greece and Italy, it was all spent or pocketed, then when the check arrives they look at it like "wait... you expect me to pay you back? Are you nuts?" Germany's trying to stick it out by providing bail-outs... but you're bailing out countries that have corrupt governments pocketing the cash and have no intention of paying anything back. You might as well toss all the cash on a bonfire. I think Britain finally got tired of this. Good for them.

0/0	Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist. The UK has to take the necessary steps to be able to live on its own. brexit is not a good time.

0/0	Britain got conned just like Trump voters. They believed all the lies and now the lies have been proven false. I hope they stay in the EU, although I know that is a long shot.
0/0	Britain has a great many talented people. However, it no longer has superiority in any particular technological field. Financial services and legal services are the exception. If we crash out without a deal, therefore, we will see a decline in our manufacturing output and it is difficult to see where the growth areas of new trade can come from aside from financial services. All this will further entrench the divide between London and the South East and the rest of Britain. The Government can try to offset this with public spending, but the Conservatives have never really been committed to this at the level it would be needed. Altogether rather a depressing picture.
0/0	Britain has already started to sink below the horizon
1/0	Britain has always punched above its weight fortunately for Europe.( Napoleon, Kaiser wilhelm, Adolf hitler ) we would rather die like lions to keep our culture our sovereignty and our freedom to being absorbed into an inefficient undemocratic top heavy club .

1/1/1	Britain has no reason to abandon its standards. But it should not be dictated to by micromanagers from Brussels who don’t have a clue about industry (financial or otherwise). London is a financial services hub. If the EU want to cut their own nose to spite their face it’s up to them.

1/1	Britain is our country! And we took it back today. A democratic country. And we are just trying to protect that and stop us letting so much influence on the decisions we make come from other countries. Countries that don't know anything about England, it's people, it's culture, it's problems and what the people of England want. Anyone who thinks Europe will ever be fully united and as one with no tension is living in gaga land. Aka Angela Merkel. Europe were talking about here. A bunch of countries in the same continent yes but each country so extremly different from the other in so many ways. And we somehow believe we can all get along, all want the same thing so should be governed by a central government that treats us like we have no sovereignty... HELL NO.
1/1	Britain is reclaiming its agency as a self-governing nation.
0/0	Britain is screwed and on a fast track to dictatorship ... But keeping their sovereignty is still preferable.
1	Britain is smarter than another european countries
0/0	Britain is splitting from the EU because people in some parts of the UK don’t want to answer to Europe and are ill-informed about the actual impact immigrants make on social services (little...it’s Tory cuts to just about any social service the government used to provide that is causing pressure). This withdrawal would also mean losing the worker’s rights they have enjoyed as a result of membership. The UK has a limited manufacturing base to support itself, and what it possesses in terms of large scale manufacturing has, with a few exceptions, begun making plans for pulling out of the country because of the implications of Brexit. There is some agricultural development but the UK is generally shifting to a largely service-based economy, services people won’t be able to pay for when their wages drop with the loss of rights, nor have time for when their working hours per week are extended. Food quality will drop as the UK imports from the US, where they have had FOUR major recalls of basic fresh food in the last three weeks, alone. But hey, blue passports! I think I understand it pretty well, no?

I saw it more like, Britain pulling off a daring, yet cheeky escape from 'Colditz' 'right under the krauts noses, escaping in a makeshift glider fashioned from a number of red cross parcels, a childs tricycle, pressed carbolic soap remnants, a christmas tree bauble and a chaiz longue acquired from Shultz' (one of the guards, long story), in exchange for a number of fork handles, our championship racing beetle 'Billy' and a tin of peas!

1/1/1/1	Britain never really believed in the EU dream. Let them leave I say! Let them be the nation that isnt part of the United States of Europe, the sick man of Europe. I care not.
1/1	Britain never voted to join the EU, it voted to join the EEC back in the 1970's which was nothing more than an innocent trading organisation, not a bad thing exactly. Sadly over the years the truth about the sinister project has come to light and through various ratification & treaties, none of which the people of the UK had a say on, the trading bloc has become an authoritarian political entity that aggressively controls the economies of its members and seeks to promote a pan-European identity. Go back in history and there's a certain German political movement that behaved the same way in the 1930/40's and we all know where that went! In fact the whole European integration idea was conceived by Nazis who escaped the noose at the Nuremberg Trials. There's nothing wrong with nations being free & independent where they can trade exactly on their terms and not receive interference from a bunch of unelected bankers & investors. With the Referendum the people took on the arrogant establishment (that still influences media & entertainment in the UK) and against their smug predictions actually won.

Where is that famous stiff upper lip? The hell with EU. Make Britain Great again!
0/-1	Britain was a powerful player because it was made rich and powerful by its empire. Now that the empire is gone so is its power. That's not hating the country it's an acceptance of the reality of where we are.
1/1	Britain was hesitant to enter into the EU and ever since it has been a bit resentful it even kept using the British Pound over the Euro. Britain being part of the EU has benefited the EU rather than the country its self. Britain prior to joining the EU had been Self Sufficient in its oil and food subsidies. Both had reached an unsustainable level because of the migrant population in the country. All of the people from other countries living there will not have to get a Visa or leave. Again that Benefits the country. They have seen the decline of other countries in the EU like Greece and said, this is not going to happen to us. Britain will not be the last country to leave either. Many People say Germany and Poland are next.
0/0	Britain went down the drain not because of the EU but you did it yourselves. Starting from the government going all the way down to the man on the street. Typical E.G. the car industry.

1/1	Britain will never fall! Britain has allways been some of the strongest country in the world. And why Brexit? It is all about uncontrolled Migrant crises dictated by Germany and France.
1/0	Britain will obviously not go into mayhem when this is all over either. Employment is decreasing, the economy is growing steadily (but not by a lot, I will concede) and the World Trade Centre will ensure that countries not in some economic, political mens club aren't in the dark.
0/0	Britain will regret for leaving the European Union. After 2 years there will be lots of crisis in Britain. Congratulations Britain.
0/0	Britain will return to the EU in 2-3 years. What Brexit supporters know, but fail to admit, is that Britain simply cannot survive outside the EU. Of course, by that time, there won't be a 'Britain', as we know it. An independent Scotland and a united Ireland spell the death knell for the UK, but Johnson and his ilk are willing for those things to happen. England and Wales will return to the EU in 2-3 years.

1/1	Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united europe? I'am sorry but britain was the one disrupting the dream of a united europe. For example: they didn't take in the euro and they didn't accept the schengen agreement(territory where the free movement of persons is guaranteed). Two things leading to a better united europe. We always knew britain was only after the trading side of joining the eu. Thats why they got rejected twice when wanting to join the eu in the first place. The way i see it: We're better off without them.
1/1	Britain's exit is not a blow to "the dream of a united Europe" at all - it is a blow to the corporate elite's dream of undemocratic inverted totalitarianism. The EU must change, an Britain is leading the way to that change.

1/1	Britain's performance has more in common with the economic recovery in the US than the Eurozone. It doesn't really look like we need the EU.

1/1	British sovereignty is a rock in an otherwise very shaky European continent which has undergone tremendous problems due to unstable continental European governments throughout history. Great Britain is very much the "watcher", overseeing Europe and always taking the high road when trouble arises. Communists, fascists, socialists, both world wars, expansionist Russia (Crimean War), Napoleon, the Sun King - we have stood up to all of them and won. It's important for Britain - more than any other country in Europe - to remain an independent guardian of freedom and democracy.

0/0	Britons left the EU and we Bosnians are still trying hard to join. Damn we're down
1/1	Britons might even be able to afford to have 3 or 4 kids again.
1/1	Britons! Vote for sovereignty and self determination! Not plutocratic bureaucrats in Brussels!
0/1	Brits and ties... What are you thinking. But please show Britain out. No deal would be the best for Europe.
1/1/1/1	Brits are an example of courage to the rest of the world.
1/1	Brits are happier outside and EU is much better without UK. Leave is real win-win solution !
0/0	Brits have any money for holidays after Brexit and the inevitable economic collapse.
0/-1	Brits have been very negative on Trump and Republican policies. Pot, meet kettle.
0/0	Brits that still think a no deal brexit is a good idea are so ignorant. I was just watching the results on tv and there were people being interviewed outside, just ordinary citizens, no politicians. A guy said to just have faith in their country, that they'd make it with or without a deal. The ignorance that comes with this nationalism is exhausting.
0/0	Brits the most stupid people on Earth :D
1/1	Brits voted Leave for all the right reasons - its a gesture/indication of Self-confidence and Strength. Don't forget these are the same people that ensured they kept their own Currency when they first ventured into the EU experiment (when they ventured on board the Titanic).
0/0/0	Brits voted for Brexit for the same reasons Americans voted for trump ... discontent mixed with ignorance.
1/-1	Brits were an obstacle to so many reforms we tried to pass that would actually make it better for everyone.
0/0	Brits will know this time next year how Brexit looks. There will certainly be victims and it is questionable who the winners will be if any. Have faith, we Americans have had to live with trump for three years, we are still here, damaged and disillusioned but still here and fighting back.
0/-1/0	Brits will no longer have that right. Brexit ended opportunities for Brits only.
0/0	Brits with less than 15 months left on their passports may not be allowed to travel to Europe under a Brexit, it is very inconvenient.
1	Brits, please vote to leave - the States don't need our greatest ally subsumed by an undemocratic, bureaucratic Leviathan - run like the wind
0/0	Brits, what the hell are you doing?
0/0	Brittisch people live with the idea of 100 years ago that they are still a super power. They will become a poor country with no power. With still the same unhappiness about their politicians.
1/-1	Brought to you by George Soros.
1/1/1	Brtian used to rule the waves, now they are nothing but slaves
1/1	Brussel bullies......we are a strong people and we don't put up with bullies
1	Brussels Set For Meltdown As EU Scrambles To Replace UK’s £8.4Billion Enjoy scraping it together guys we will enjoy
1/-1	Brussels broadcasting corporation
0/1	Brussels dictates very little on British way of life. It has no say on UK VAT rates, corporate income tax rates, or personal income tax rates. It has no say on UK foreign policy.
1/-1	Brussels do not pass go do not collect 20 billion pounds
1/-1	Brussels will now find they have much less importance in the world absent Britain.
1/1	Btw congratz England on brexit, and you old timers we are still European, we have a strong bond and nothing will change that, we Norwegians are just happy you got control of your country back
0/0	Bulgaria forgives you. Please stay in the EU! We can work on being more romantic!
1/0	Bullsh+t pro EU propaganda !!!!
0/0	Bumped into acquaintance at shop this morning. Asked how she was. Said fine looking forward to Friday. I looked totally blank. She then said “Coming out on Friday. Are you going to the party at the pub?” The lunatics are now totally in charge of the asylum.
0/0	Bumps in the road? probably because we wont be able to afford to fix them anymore!
0/0	Bunch of old people celebrating for something that will affect the new generation and not them…
0/0	Bunch of racist who have little regard or knowledge of what a hard Brexit will do to our economy .
1/1	Burn Lisbon, No Deal and remove us from this corpse. It has taken it's last breath and is starting to smell. Move us out of the mire for good.
0/0	Burn your country to the ground because you don't like immigration....brilliant!
1/1	Burned an EU flag this morning in my back garden and asked Alexa to play "Ode to Joy" as my wee contribution to the celebrations today. Can't tell you how happy I am!!
0/0	Bury Brexshit
0/0/0	Business owner who claimed Brexit would make Britain thrive loses his business
0/1	Business owner who claimed Brexit would make Britain thrive loses his business, all his money and blames Brexit. Does it get any better?
1/1	Business? Brexit is more important even if the British people have to pay the price and are poor - Brexit first
1/1	Businesses have shafted the people for decades, and the EU is the vehicle for shafting us even more.
1/1	But EU is anti-democratic organization, so it makes sense to reject the pessent who think their vote matters
0/0	But I actually agree with what Theresa May said last April; Brexit would be a disaster for the UK economy and trade.
1/1	But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
0/0	But a System it not helped by leaving it, but by putting effort into changing it. The EU is a product of a political process and not an already finished end-product. I don't understand your argumentation
1/1	But do you trust the European government more than the government of your own country? I would think you have more control/influence over your national government than over that monster in Brussels
0	But farmers are to get protection from Brexit to the tune of £3bn why cant small businesses claim that same level of protection from Brexit... why and how is Brexit so good when we need Protection from it? - Where is ours?
0/0	But for the majority, it's a moment of despair. But we will rejoin - probably sooner than you think.
0/0	But in fact only 37% of the voting population voted to leave.. no way a majority.
1/1	But it's not about money it's about sovereignty and if the cost is measured in £ or $ it'll be way cheaper than last time we decided we didn't want to be part of a European (German) state. A price many Americans paid for us at that time too. Money isn't everything !
1/1	But its not just the backstop is it its the 39b the 21 month extension fishing gibraltar the falklands and so much more we dont even hear about now all swept under the carpet all extra money for the eu mafia
0/-1	But leaving the EU on the 31st of October with or without a deal will not get Brexit done. You really are a barefaced liar. It is just the beginning of the process, and might I had a process of impoverishing those most in need.
0/-1	But now you taken the damages AND still have to pay for the NHS. Taking the best of both sides!
1/1	But outside the echo-chamber that is the metropolitan liberal class, the real people of Britain saw things differently
1/0	But surely all these problems will be auto-magicaly resolved by leaving the EU, since they were EUs fault anyway.
0/0	But the EU is going to ban cups of tea, front doors, water, and air. So I heard.
1/1	But the EU remains a conglomeration of vastly differing countries in size, language, culture, economy and a hundred other things. It can never be moulded into a single state.
0/-1	But the NHS will get 350 million a week from now on and we will get blue passports!
1/-1	But the Remainers told me they'd be massive Visa Fees ? You're telling me they lied? :/
1/0	But the U.K. can use memes freely. Who is the real winner here?
1/1	But what about democracy. There has already been a vote. But if the people who voted no get in power they just tell the people who won to piss off? That’s how you get civil unrest.
0/0	But you are free to dream further of your Lala land where the whole world is on its knees to get granted some breadcrumbs by the British empire. I am sure that times are long gone by now.
1/1	Buy British : beef, pork, milk, butter, apples, lamb, fish, cheese, new world wines, British clothing, British US and Japanese cars, holiday in UK or Commonwealth, UK beers, household items, fly BA if at all.
0/0/0	Buy British would result in starvation of half of the Brits.
0/0	By Brexit the UK shot itself in the belly when fishing.
0/0	By all accounts we (as a whole) think brexit is a mistake and would vote to remain in the EU.
1/1	By demographics we are still part of Europe. But we simply don’t wish to be ruled by the EU. It’s so simple!
0/0	By disrupting 45 years of agreements and treaties the UK are causing unnecessary chaos.
0/0	By leaving UK will lose Scotland and NI, and many jobs. They think they are a colonial power, but they are not. We are in 2019, not in 1800..
0/0	By leaving the EU your damaging the economy, so many businesses have chosen to leave the UK due to the possible ramifications of this decision. A start up company that I worked for had to fire hundreds of employees due to them having to relocate as a direct result of leaving the EU, as most of their products were sourced from Europe. I swear there needs to be an IQ test before they allow people to vote. Bunch of thick scrounging scum bags get an education and maybe people from other countries wouldn't have to do "your" jobs for you !
1/1	By leaving, we will again be able to determine who does and does not enter the UK
1/1	By staying in the imperial dictatorship of the EU. That is medieval!
0/0/0	By stopping Brexit, investing in skills and providing tailored support to key industries, we can get the UK economy back on track and help the communities that have been hit hardest by the threat of Brexit.
0/0	By voting for Brexit, I think we are on course to make Britain inhospitable to many foreign workers who help our country function.
1/1	By withdrawing from the EU, we can organise economic and social affairs in this country not by deliberate design from the top down
1/1	Bye Brits ,just go with your arrogance and racism. EU owns majority of your companies ,so guess where they will go after Brexit.
1/1	Bye Bye EU BYE BYE. The FT don't like the little people winning! Ha ha ha.

1/1/1	CELEBRATE!

1/1	CONGRATULATIONS To the British for regaining their FREEDOM !! No matter what the cost, a little or a lot, you will never regret this day. AMERICA IS WITH YOU !!!
1/1	CONGRATULATIONS, BRITAIN!! MUCH LOVE AND ENVY FROM CANADA!!
1/1	Call there bluff, watch the EU come running.
1/1	Calling a second EU referendum will further damage the government proving does not listen to the will of this country. The people of the country have voted out and this needs to be respected and honoured The public has cast their votes and voted for a Brexit. This should be respected. If the EU referendum had resulted in a remain vote coming out as the majority then the leave campaign would not get a 2nd referendum. Whatever the result for the referendum, the goalposts should not be moved because one side has lost.
1/1	Cameron and Osborne lied. The ivory tower bureacracy of the EU is opposed to democracy. The road to hell is paved with unaccountable bureaucrats.
0/1	Cameron was not honourable in his departure, he was dishonourable in getting the UK to this position stoking the language that meant a Leave vote was a success.
0/-1	Campaigners for another EU referendum have gathered in Edinburgh to repeat calls to "stop the clock" on Brexit
0/0	Can Boris Johnson refund me and thousands of expats the money lost from my pension (converted to euros) due to the pound devaluing after the #Brexit vote, of which he was an instigator? Only then he can carry on bullshitting.
0/0/0	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too
0/0	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too!
1/1	Can I ask you a question that no politician, past and present remainer has answered, and that is what are the benefits of the EU for the working class. There are none, the aim is to make us poorer,and the rich , richer, it is happening.
1/1	Can Remainers continue complaining after we have left? Maybe they should rename them selves the Returners and start campaigning to return.
1/1	Can anyone suggest even ONE sensibly honest and practical reason for Britain remaining under EU commission rule?
0/1	Can anyone tell me just how drunk Camo was when he decided to go for a referendum on EU membership?
0/0	Can anyone who voted to leave please explain to me how we are going to get better trade deals with the EU than we have/had.
1/0	Can laughing at #Brexit bring #Leavers and #Remainers together?
0/0	Can some politician have an ’Emperors new clothes’ moment please and ask the government to justify this fiasco without reverting to ’will of the people’. We have no withdrawal deal, no trade deal in sight, no arrangement on services, Scotland wants to leave the UK, there is no solution is sight for NI, Gibraltar will be open to Spanish claims. The government is making plans for food and medicine shortages, gridlock and riots. Teresa May, I challenge you to justify this mess.
1/-1	Can someone explain to me how they can cancel something that was voted to happen. Seems like it’s going against democracy
0/0	Can stop blaming the evil EU and start blaming "Londoners"? Always great to find a new scapegoat.
0/1/1	Can the BBC manage to shut up now on brexit and find some other drivel to inflate out of proportion?
1/1	Can these globalists shut up already? The people voted, at least pretend we still have democracy.
0/0	Can they change their minds and rejoin later, once they sober up?
1/1	Can we get a 'Go Fund Me' page to help unleash the UK's potential?
1/1/0/1/1	Can we have another vote. I don’t think 17.4 million people did actually vote for Brexit. Arghhhhhh. Hahahahaha Ya cry babies, we’ve done it. Middle finger.
0/1	Can we implement the referendum result please - and don't carp on about a deal. If you leave, you leave!
0/0/0	Can we just forget about BREXIT and act as if it never ever happened at all?
0/0	Can we just stop Brexit now? It was fun for a bit but now its just tedious..
1/1	Can we nuke Brussels yet?
1/1	Can we please just leave
0/0	Can we sue TM for taking us hostage on this undeliverable brexshit rollercoaster.
1/-1	Can you believe anything broadcast on the mainstream anymore, they will not accept the will of the British people
0/0	Can you imagine ANY other circumstances when a THIRD of UK businesses would be planning to move out of the country? This is on your head @theresa_may @Conservatives & unless you stop enabling Brexit, you too @jeremycorbyn
0/1	Can you quantify how the EU needs us more than we need them? In all sectors of the economy, please. With the government's own figures as to the consequences of No Deal, especially number of jobs lost #BrexitLies
1/1	Can't believe Remainers think the EU is a good thing!? It beggars belief. It threats the peoples & Nations of Europe with contempt
1/1	Can't believe how brainwashed the Remainers and uninformed those young adults are. Stop the bickering, grow a pair and get patriotic. Britain will be far better off outside than in (b.t.w. I'm an educated white collar worker). I'm fully prepared to trade one or two years of uncertainty for a lifetime of self rule and all the prosperity it'll give to Britain from innovation, entrepreneurship and true free trade. Rule Britannia!
0	Can't believe people were that deluded to vote leave... The poor sods! Glad we are staying
1/1	Can't believe some people still trying to "get around" the #Brexit.
1/1	Can't come soon enough. Make Britain Great again.
1/1	Can't help thinking, if the EU is such a utopia, why do so many people risk their lives crossing the Channel to get out of it? These people come from complete shit holes, but after a few days in France they'd rather die than stay there. ROFLMFAO
1/0	Can't leave until the EU says so!  Who in their right mind would sign up to a deal like this?
0/-1	Can't remember who said it, but I have found the quote: "The EU is made up of small nations and nations that don't realize that they are small yet". A country of 10-60 million doesn't have the influence (as in possible market) needed on the world stage to promote it's values and protect it's citizens from countries and corporations alike.
1/-1/-1	Can't see it happening. The EU would rather destroy itself than agree a good deal with the UK in case it looks like the UK, ' has got away with it ' to their minds.
1/1	Can't wait for EU away #Brexit
0/1	Can't wait for Scotland and Northern Ireland to secede and get their due independence from the UK. Next few years will be an absolute blast.
0/0	Can't wait for Scotland and Northern Ireland to secede and get their due independence from the UK. Next few years will be an absolute blast. I wonder how much less than the € the pound will be worth. Less than the dollar, quite possibly. Good Times.
0/0/0/0/0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
0/0	Can't wait for food prices to rise
1/1	Can't wait for no deal brexit. Should have said to the EU two and half years ago, wto rules or free trade agreement.
1/0	Can't wait til 5 years time when we have a referendum to join again
1/1	Can't wait till 29 march when no deal Brexit happens!
1/-1/0	Can't wait till the license fee is scrapped so BBC are thrown in the capitalist shark tank. Wont live long.

1/0	Can't wait to get them British of the EU's back. Finally some good news for europé
1/1	Can't wait to leave the EU. Corrupt wankers.
1/1	Canada, a child of Britain, has more sovereignty then the United Kingdom. Canada refused to be absorbed by the union to their south. The UK just gave up.
1/1	Canary Wharf alone is substantially larger than the EU's largest financial centre - Frankfurt
0/0	Cancel Brexit
0/0	Cancel Brexit and the Tory party.
0/0	Cancel Brexit please.
0/0	Cancel brexit
0/0	Cancelling brexit is the best option.
1/1	Cancelling brexit means cancelling democracy. It means not giving people what they chose. It is a TERRIBLE, very serious precedent. I expect people supporting brexit filling the streets soon!
0/0	Cannot believe it that people actually voted for an exit...
0/0	Cant believe the English were that stupid to vote to leave the EU
0/0	Cant wait for Scotland to the same to not so really united kingdom.
0/-1	Can’t believe that as a country we’d prefer to spend £92m to *design* a shittier alternative to a project we were an integral part of rather than continue to co-operate with the French.
1/1	Can’t wait for Brexit! We need to take our country back! If only we’d never joined
1/1	Can’t wait for a new trade deal and closer defense ties with the UK
0/0	Can’t wait for the financial crash after berxit. I’ll be able to pick up a house dirt cheep
0/0	Can’t wait to hear the leavers complaining that the remainers didn’t make them aware of the associated consequences in leaving the EU. All I will say is this ’you’ve got your cake, now stuff your faces and help yourself to some chlorinated chicken’. The fight has just begun and it will destroy the tories and hopefully the right wing media along with it.
0/0	Captain blob a job has just steered the brexitanic into the iceberg and is now frantically arranging the deck chairs
1/1	Careful madam Merkel might send you off too the work camps. No deal is the only valid option left, the main leaders of the EU have publicly said no way in hell can that deal be modified, if any of those leaders now change they minds, those leaders and their parties would lose all power in they home lands. Those leaders have backed themselves into a box they cant hope too get out of without losing, which has forced the UK In to a no deal, the only other option left too us is too stay and that would still force us too leave due too civil unrest like France is currently in the middle of. That's one lesson all UK MPs need too think of ATM.
0/0	Careful with those facts buddy, you forget we have morons in this country that voted leave, wouldn’t want to scare them
0	Carry on with Brexit and earn your place as the woman who did not listen, destroying party, the UK and our futures.
0/-1	Carswell should remain very quiet. If the economy has not taken a hit in the next 12-24 months, he may have a point. We are all now waiting to see what sort of trade agreement emerges. If we end up heading towards WTO - which will be apparent by the Summer - the £ will take a huge hit again and God help manufacturing and agriculture. The reality of what Brexiteers have done has yet to reveal itself. So let's see what happens. You own Brexit, Carswell. It's your responsibility if things turn bad.
0/1	Celebrate good times
1/1/1	Celebrate your independence Britain!
1/-1	Celebrating "Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations" by burning a flag
1/1	Celebrations 👍
0/-1	Certainly EU itself would radically change or possibly even fall apart if Britain leaves, meaning a whole new set of European order would emerge
0/0	Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: “We are a global business with a strong presence in Europe. “We have a rich heritage in the UK, with 30 years of manufacturing . . . Last year we produced more than 475,000 vehicles in the UK – 80 per cent of which are exported. “Our preference as a business is, of course, that the UK stays within Europe - it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs. For us, a position of stability is more positive than a collection of unknowns. “We obviously want the Nissan UK plant and engineering centre to remain as competitive as possible when compared with other global entities, and each future investment opportunity will be taken on a case by case basis, just as it is now.”
1	Chance of a better trade relationships with other non-EU countries.
1/1	Chance to increase trade in emerging markets quicker than remaining in the EU bloc.
1/1	Change can cause hardships but change is inevitable, the eu was causing hardship and could have got much worse.

1/1	Churchill would not have surrendered. He did not surrender to the Germans in 1940, unlike the current Conservative Prime Minister. The UK should tell the EU how it is leaving, not ask. That is what Churchill would have done.

0	Claire O'Neill, sacked by Dominic Cummings on Friday from running the UK climate change conference in Glasgow, claims Johnson has provided net zero leadership. Britain fought hard diplomatically to run this conference as a sign of its post-Brexit engagement. Cannot afford this.
1/-1	Classic example of the political elite being so out of touch with the average man in the street.
1/1	Clean break Boris is what we voted for, nothing more, we want to go WTO
1/-1	Clean brexit please
0/-1	Clear case of a colonial depression
0/0	Clear stuff. The ONLY alleged opportunities if Brexit arise from the ability to sign independent trade deals. That means if Brexiters cannot prove they are able to fix BETTER trade deals, the UK should remain in the EU.
0/0	Clever name. That is all.
1/1	Climate change? The climate always changes, directed by the Sun. Boris... That is a EU hoax. Leave that as well... Talk to China and India about their pollution.
1/1	Clive Thomas, its the EU that will end up bankrupt without our handouts. If anyone cannot deal with life after Brexit then pack your bags and go live in one of the corrupt EU member states.
1/1	Closing their border would be a good idea if it would be 2 sided and happend earlier. Imigrants counldn't enter britain and also british people couldn't exit their land killing people and ruin every place in the world.
1/1	Cod stocks are almost depleted anyway, so there will be a price rise due to supply and demand. It's been unsustainably fished by french trawlers (allowed by the EU) in our fishing areas.

1/1	Come on brexit we want out got it out means out
1/1	Come on let's get out now no deal they need us more than we ever needed them.forty billion could do a lot for our United kingdom not Europe.
1/1	Come on, UK! INDEPENDENCE!
0/0	Come on, you has like 10% of the seats in the European Parliament, you have alot of power xD To make laws in European Union legislative procedure it requires at least 50%, so if you already have 10% you can make a big difference, just saying..
0/0	Coming from a northerner we will literally go into poverty. Wigan and all the other high unemployment areas in the UK are gonna look like Africa. Brexit was a mistake.
0/1/-1	Commission website clearly states they have control of the agenda, only they can initiate or, even more importantly, repeal bad laws. Some civil service. The parliament is elected, but they have a binary choice to vote yes or no, so they all vote yes to preserve their project and their expense accounts (still no receipts required or even publication, TI said it was "hugely disappointing"). Not a mature democracy. How much introspection has the EU engaged in since 2016? Not a lot. Seemingly incapable of reform whilst the Commission holds so much power. The member state politicians seem to love being able to pass the Commission's laws, which they can then blame the EU for if they prove not to be popular.
1/0	Common market not wannabe country! We voted for the former not the latter! Vote yes to leave the wannabe country!
0/-1	Common wealth, fastest joke ever.
0/-1	Commoner, realist & proud son of Irish Immigrants since 1975. Financial Adviser since 2004. More likely than ever to say he told you so since Dec 2019.
0/0	Commonwealth will soon be dominated again by one country but this time it will be India with over 50% of the population . The UK will be an outpost.
1/1	Companies should pay enough to live off. Its crazy that people work full time in this country and that wage is topped up by state benefits. You might not like it but the fact is that is partly due free movement.
0/0	Compare UK pre- and post-’73, more rights, better food & coffee, cleaner environment, even more wonderful students. No brainer. #VoteRemain
0/-1	Compared to all the Remain marches it's a tiny turnout. But more importantly, let it go .. it's sad how you keep banging on about it ..
1/1	Compared with the international market, the EU has caused people here to pay more for these things. Once the UK is out of Europe, people face cheap food prices, and they only have to pay the same price as anywhere else in the world. This is very good for us.
1/1	Complacency and comfort are our greatest enemies. Being a part of a failing EU bureaucracy would have keep us in such a state until it was to late to do anything about it.
1/1	Complete and utter tripe - our best chance is to get out now rather than sink even deeper into the mire. Revenge will come as we regenerate and the EU experiment implodes.
0/0	Completely agree I'm 17 and the large of my age group/generation voted remain as you know
1/1	Completely baffling - 53% of voters want to see housing, NHS and Education disasters, an ever-expanding Brussels federal vampire squid, and a population in our tiny island soaring over the 100- million mark in the space of as little as 30 years. Are they MAD? As for a "LEAVE" economic collapse, it will take us twenty years to extricate ourselves from the sinking EU Titanic - unless it collapses beforehand - so why wouldn't the sun rise on Friday morning? REMAIN lobby beware - voting to stay only delays the day you will HAVE to vote LEAVE.
1/1	Completely democratic. Proud of my fellow remainers!
0/0	Compulsive liar #LiarJohnson is calling the transition arrangement to carry on in as if still in EU until the end of the year the "deal" He literally doesn't care that intelligent people know he's lying as long as he can fool enough idiots. #LiarsGonnaLie

0/0	Confederate States of America anyone? The South decided to leave (like Britain) and it hurt their economy (like it will Britain's). I personally believe this was a stupid idea, but I live in the US where we already figured this out before.

0/0	Congratulation to the ever-polite and patient Monsieur Barnier to point out ONCE AGAIN that the EU does not need us more than we need them. As for not paying the £39 billion we owe, it will be a clear sign to all countries around the world that we are dishonest and incapable of honouring the terms of a contract. Nobody will want to sign a trade deal with us.

Can't believe that people didn't check out the full implications instead of swallowing all those divisive lies - smoke and mirrors, and bigotry. I read and listened to so much stuff that it felt like my eyes and ears were bleeding. If we thought we were desperate before the referendum, just wait and see what's coming. I'm too old to emigrate to anywhere in the Commonwealth (there's an oxymoron for you) ... sheesh!!! I'd love a referendum on the royal family though ...... errrm, no scratch that, so many damn fools would vote to keep them because "She's a lovely old woman".

0/0	Conning people into thinking they were voting for “ freedom” or “taking back control” and then handing over money to support idiot manipulators like Tommy Robinscum is just another form of slavery by the back door. More zero hr contracts, more exploitation by the “elites” they fight against, which include Tommy Robinscum and Farage, who are coining it in on the back of Brexit
0/0	Conservatives will destroy everything, literally, in the world given the chance.
1/1	Considering how “toxic” the EU were and how much they held against us I’m surprised people aren’t happy with leaving. Even if they wanted to stay in the EU, I feel they shown enough of their real intent to put people off staying in. But that’s not happened and to those of you who still want to be in the EU, after all that was said what kept you motivated to Remain?
0/0	Considering that the people were told lies in order to vote for brexit, chances are that another referendum will end with a clear majority for staying. If there is an honest campaign that properly informs the people on what to expect anyway.
0/0	Considering the UK economy will take some time to reconfigure from plugging the gaps by immigration Brexit is likely just to mean poorer people will come from further away for the first few years at least. Irony is fun!
1/1	Constantly trying to use misdirection by talking about business. We didn't vote on protecting rich business owners. We voted to leave the EU. LEAVE MEANS LEAVE! AND DOES NOT MEAN WITH A DEAL!
1/1/1	Control of our own Laws.

0/0	Count down to the end of UK herself. Scotland will seperate from UK, Ireland will reunite. No UK, no more Great Britain, only England. A country smaller than the size of Tunisia """""""WON'T"""""" be a """"GREAT""'" anything. It will only be an overseas territory of the USA. 😂

1/1	Criticism from the 'plebs' is beneath Eurocrats. Time to get out of this elitist club
1/0	Crowds were gathered at Calais to bid a sad farewell to Britain before Boris Johnson pulled up the colossal anchor which has been holding the islands firmly in place for thousands of years. It was a clear morning as the gigantic, barnacle encrusted mass of iron was hoisted above the water for all to see. Rivers of tears were shed as masses of EU onlookers watched the British Isles begin to slowly float away from the European continent. This is a truly astonishing day.
1/-1	Crying for their salary
0/0	Cummings and Johnson are banning words such as "Brexit", "Deal", "No Deal". They want No Deal without Brexit being blamed. Use these words as much as possible online and in real life. They are brainwashing.
1/1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU.
1/1/1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU. Did the EU give you a grant for your video? It's biased in many areas! The UK is being punished by the EU for the democratic decision of it's people.
1/1	Currently standing In Parliament Square, waiting for the celebrations to begin

0/0	Damn your way of debating is so inefficient no wonder your empire fell appart
0/0/0	Damn... so it's finally happening. It feels weird somehow... Definitely one of those historic moments. All problems aside, it's definitely a sad moment for the project EU and for Europe as a whole. The Union isn't perfect and it definitely needs reforms in certain aspects, but the concept as such is a big achievement and we should fight to keep it going. Together we stand, divided we fall.
0/0	Dang it were out now
0/0	Danger of democracy - the uninformed voting for people as uninformed as themselves - leads to chaos,confusion, and little progress to a better life, individually or nationally.
1/0	Dangerous times ahead.People are being asked to vote on a subject that the great British public knows so little about.
1/0	Dark and undemocratic forces have been at work for over two years trying to stop Brexit. They are still hard at it, but running out of time. My message to the sneering Metropolitan liberal elite is to turn over a new leaf in 2019, accept that democracy is better than autocracy and that the electorate knows better than you do.
1/0	David Cameron must be excluded from front bench politics ever again. He deserted his post, and is as much a snake as Tony BLiar. NO! Never again. The EU is not a club!!!! It's a political Union, I don't want to live in a state in a country called Europa.
0/0	David Cameron needs to CANCEL this Referendum NOW. Screw public opinion because the EU is needed for our economic prosperity.
0/-1	David Cameron played us. He was as arrogant as they come, gambling with our country, cut and ran when he lost.
1/1	David Cameron simply thought he could re-apply his Scottish Independent referendum project-fear tactics as a strategy for Brexit. Well, he failed.

0/0	Dear "left behind" brexiters, it seems the Conservative *do* have money for your communities, they just didn't want to give it to you. I guess you'll blame the EU for this as well?
1/1	Dear #Remainers, #Leavers are our teachers, our doctors, our nurses, our grans, our nephews, our neighbours, our volunteers in charities, our pillars of the community, our foodbank contributors. They're half of us. Disagree with them, by all means. But we have to live together.

1/1	Dear Channel 4 not a SINGLE leave voter will vote remain. I will put £1000 of my own money on a bet that if there were a second referendum the LEAVE vote will be MUCH higher. We've seen nothing but a political class spectacularly fail on leaving the first time and now our wills are like iron. You failed to do it properly the first time and we will absolutely WRECK you if a second referendum comes.

0/0	Dear british, I have the impression that your politicians have totaly lost their minds. Putting the economy of a whole country on the line because of some stupid political BS is treason - or isn't it?
0/0	Dear friends, if you choose to leave the EU, you will destroy your economy. You think you can leave EUs trading bloc and puff, you'll negotiate a deal and it will be just like before, only this time you'll be free... Frankly that's bs. Not only will it take years to establish new trading agreements with the EU and with third party counties(since Britain was relying on EUs already established trading agreements with these third party countries)
0/0	Dear oh dear Brexit; what a complete and utter mess! And sadly this was all totally predictable after 23 June 2016. It was bound to happen when stupid people voted leave primarily to stop immigration to the UK (which Brexit WON’T do by the way!) without considering the financial social and economic consequences of their actions. What Brexiteers did in effect was to sign a blank contract the details of which are now being filled in by the EU. What kind of idiot would do that??

1/1	Democracy in the U.K. will never be the same again. Just deselect the MPs who are not following the wishes of their constituents.
0/0	Democracy is under attack: They lied, cheated & broke the law to win the referendum. Funnelled £Millions into pro #Brexit propaganda ads. Now they restrict access of the press to government briefings. This is an Orwellian nightmare!

1/1/-1	Democracy represents everyone. The losers in a general election don’t pack up and go home.
1/1	Democracy will only be served when we're out of the EU with a No Deal. We did not ask for a deal, it's the EU's job to offer a deal and ours to accept what we feel is a deal. That's where May got it wrong in the first place.
1/1	Democracy wins- despite three years of hard work by the establishment remainers trying to block Brexit, it looks like it's finally happening. I wish the EU the best of luck in the future but am personally glad the UK will no longer partake in the political project to create a federal Europe, led by France and Germany
1/1	Democracy won in the end.
0/0	Democracy's biggest fail. I hope they don't regret it
1/1	Democracy, integrity, and self-determination win through at last
1/1	Democratic UK will thrive and move ahead economically against the undemocratic EU bureaucracy fools.
0/0	Denialism is the new mantra, Brexiters thought they would leave with better conditions than actual members of the EU and other countries would follow, well events have proved otherwise.
1/1	Deranged lies. The UK is growing faster than France or Germany, despite the lies that they would be in a depression after the vote. Try to grow up.
1/-1	Deselect the lot of them that cause trouble
1/0/1	Desperate remainers trying to make us brexiters look bad no doubt
1/1	Desperate times for the EU. Brexit has exposed the political power behind the surface bonhomie. The EU needs to modernise before it becomes any more like the Soviet Union.
0/0	Despite the Euroskeptics fear mongering and using false stats all the time. Never mind all the assumptions and poorly research 'migrant stats' that they love to reel off (fyi they are usually wrong).
1/1	Despite the scares nothing much will change if we leave the EU. Except we will be free and independent.
1/1/-1	Despite what the loony left media and a handful of quislings tell you, there is no major desire in the UK to stop brexit.
0/0	Destroy Britain's economy, leave the EU
0/0	Devastating for the country I love.
0/0	Did not know people can be that dumb
0/1	Did we finally find a positive of Brexit?
1/1	Did you catch that......... Mr Rees-Mogg said he is willing to pay for it... Well I'm not, I would not give the EU a penny, they are keeping £billions of pounds of assets which we paid for, there is no reason to bail them out further.
0/0	Did you enjoy eating shhittt on Brexit day as you celebrated your gullibility!
1/-1	Did you notice the long faces at the "unbiased" BBC?
0	Did you vote #Brexit to ‘give the establishment a kick up the backside’? Wholly reasonable! You have succeeded. But did you really vote for this? Did you give a mandate for this debacle? Time to Rethink? #FinalSay
1/1	Did you vote to renegotiate our terms? I didn't.
1/1	Didn't vote for it but I'm up for Brexit deal/no deal PROVIDING there's lots of useful criticism of it from the Lords or anyone.
0/0	Didn't we say this would happen? And didn't #BorisJohnson assure us it wouldn't happen? But, apparently it's going to happen. We'll, I'm shocked! #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
1/1	Direct democracy at last. Cry Freedom. FREE AT LAST!!
0/0	Direct democracy doesn't work. It's like asking an english teacher how to repair a broken motor.
0/0	Disaster. I'm ashamed of my home country and will seek Scottish citizenship now that their independence is practically guaranteed.
1/1	Disgusted with Mogg putting his party before the country. It is law if we don't get a deal we leave with no deal has he said himself. So why all this rubbish about a 2nd referendum something stinks.
0/0	Disgusting.. what failed us was the negotiators not the EU Shame on all the Brexit Bigots!!

0/0	Do I support Brexit in is current shambolic form? Absolutely not.
0/0	Do I support Brexit? No.
0/0	Do I think that the EU is a fantastic institution? No. But I think that the handling of Brexit has been a farce. All the lies that were revealed, and no-one is accountable. All the people at the top jumped ship leaving us with an unelected PM, and an incompetent brexit team. More than anything I wish there was some accountability for the bs propaganda machine, and I feel like a mug for wanting to believe the promises.
1/1/1	Do it. Why have a union when you can have an EMPIRE
1/1	Do liberals not understand that people can see through their magic, disappearing illegal in the phrase illegal immigrants? That's why Brexit won. Stop thinking you've a monopoly on being right. Some people value sovereignty over prices being a bit lower.
0/0	Do not blame the trouble ahead on Nicola or the SNP. This Brexit is out of control. Own the trouble now
0/-1	Do not dissent. Do not demonstrate. Do not allow journalists to ask questions. Do not listen to countries in the Union who disagree. Do not mention the word Brexit, do not do what's right for many who voted for you... Do what is right for your career.

0/0	Do not play chicken with the EU.
1/-1	Do really think prior to joining the EU back in 73 i think it was that if we had known that our pound would have dropped from 240 pence to a 100 pence and that out oil and gas fields were going to be sold of to EU corporations
0/0	Do the british people really think that not being in the EU can stop the migrants
0/0	Do the people who are happy to exit on WTO terms realise we would have the same access to the world markets as countries such as South Sudan
1/1	Do the remainers not understand the end goal of the EU? Well I spell it out for them. It means the end of nations and all the diversity and freedom that brings.
1/1	Do these anti brexiteers have any idea of the consequences of their actions? Possibly out of a job at the next election - or national unrest.
1/0	Do these muppets not realise what they are doing? These useful idiots are going against our democratic voice. How many referendums will they want until they get what they want? Communism is alive and well in the UK.

0/1	Do we create a Better Britain in a Better Europe for a Better World?
1/1	Do we hell as like you morons. We had the vote, we’ve had the result now deliver what the country voted for and get on with it.
1/1	Do we know what to expect if we are kept in the EU? Continuous industries loss, job losses and ties into treaty of lisbon!
0/0	Do you hate or pity Boris Johnson for the dishonesty he has used to get his way on Brexit. Upto 2016 he wanted to stay but then he asked whats in it for me and changed his mind to leave so he would gain at our Country's expense
0/0	Do you honestly think Brussels will give the UK a good trade deal post-Brexit? We'd be very lucky if we got anything at all. Of course Germany and France would want to insist on a reasonable one for their benefit, but how much of a "good" trade deal is uncertain. Also, Germany and France are the UK's largest trade partners after the USA, why risk jeopardizing this in a movement that is likely to stir political resentment?
1/0	Do you know how much the EU cost me? £13 a year. Admittedly, that was when my pay was 17k. £13 for the countryto freely trade with the other European nations and get preferential terms with other nations.
0/-1	Do you remember when the UK was a great place to live? Whatever happened to that country!
1/1	Do you remember when we were promised that the UK would leave the Customs Union in March 2019? We should, because the Prime Minister stated so 23 times in the House of Commons alone.
1/1	Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
1/-1	Do you want Brexit with that?" "Brexit is a way of life"

0/-1/0	Dodgy financial decisions and voting for brexit are not related?
0/0	Does Britain realise it’s been fucked? You still have to pay EU contributions but don’t have a say in the EU. Boris really sold this as a win in the country?
0/0	Does anyone still believe that Brexit wasn't about joining a race to the bottom on standards and regulations?
1/-1	Does he really lack support for this people Boris Johnson's push to diverge from EU regulations lacks public support
1/1	Does the name Anna Lindh mean anything? In 2003 Sweden went to the polls in a referendum on the euro the pro side were way out in front until the murder of this women. Goes to show the damage it can do I bet Cameron rubbed his hands in delight.....vote leave people

1/1	Does this mean we can have our own version of 4th of july so we send up 2X the amount of fireworks lol
1/1	Does your house have a front door? Why? Could it be you want to control who comes and goes? The presence of the door doesn't stop you from talking to your neighbor, working with them on projects, exchanging a few beers etc, but at the end of the day, it's your house, no one else's. Do you let your neighbour tell you when the door should be open?
1/1	Doesn't address the fact that the EU is a already a sinking boat. Better to jump ship now while you still can.
1/-1	Doesn't it make you feel proud!
0/0	Doesn't seem like a great idea, but it's not my country. I like Britain and hope they do alright.
1/1/1/1/1	Doesnt matter how you look at it,a no deal scenario is the best deal by far. Only then can we square up to the EU with a very good case for a free trade deal that is at least fair to the UK.
0/0	Doesn’t matter anymore Simon. Brexit is `done’, Johnson has an 80 seat majority.
0/0	Doire Finn attended the demonstration yesterday to give a clear message - Brexit will not be put in the way of our fragile peace process & a hard border will not be tolerated by any community in Northern Ireland. This is our future stability at risk!!

1/1	Dominic Raab will visit Australia, Japan, Singapore & Malaysia this week in a post-Brexit trade drive as Boris puts Global Britain into action! We've always been bigger than a star on someone else's flag. Now it's time to tell the world: "We're back and open for business!"

0/0	Don't you realise that if brexit happens there won't even be a UK. Scotland will demand independence as the majority voted remain. We'll be half an island off the coast of a massively successful trading block!
0/1	Donald Tusk, *former* President of EU Council, gets 15 minutes to undermine Brexit (such as by encouraging Scottish independence) • Nigel Farage, who made Brexit happen, gets 2 minutes on Marr Sofa.

1/1	Don¿t be like Greece which voted to stay in and have been taken over and pushed into the ground. Take this one opportunity to escape domination by the EU secretive power elite, and taste the sweetness of freedom and opportunity, leave austerity behind, get up off our knees and take back our initiative, enterprise, inspiration, and success around the world. Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for. Fortune favours the brave. Tim Peake did it in space, we can do it on Earth. Take courage and do it for all our futures. VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Don’t be so ridiculous, pat, this is the ugly face of Brexit - it is a philosophy propounded by many far right groups which can lead to attacks on immigrants.
0	Don’t compare Brexit to jumping of a cliff either. Call it liberating ourselves from the cliff. We are free from the evil grasp of the cliff and free to move freely! Doesn’t matter about the lack of wings, we’ll sort that little detail out later.
0/0	Don’t forget the air. I breathed it in on Saturday morning and once I’d got past the carbon dioxide / monoxide, nitrous oxide and all other pollutants, the air just seemed more free. You can’t put a price on that benefit. Well, not until the Tories privatise air of course
0/0	Don’t get what everyone is celebrating,

0/0/0	Don’t hold your breath. The true effects of Brexit are waiting down the road. Promises will soon become more vague and problems will be laid at the door of the E U. Having conned people that the E.U. has caused all our problems they will now have face the consequences. Can’t wait to see where all this money is going to come from to replace EU grants with a government that wants to lower taxes. Huge conn.

0/0	EU is far more democratic then the UK . Wales , NI & Scotland have nothing to say , only England matters .House of lords = a bunch of non elected old men. House of common : The voting system : the winner takes it all is from the middle ages ( the knights !) only good for 1 party , the others have nothing ... democratic is a weird word in the UK.
1/-1/1	EU is not a democratic institution, it is a complete technocracy government ruled by lobbies ( a bit in an american fashion) with a bunch of non-elected people deciding important laws over natonal sovereignty, I can agree to a europe, but rather the europe of nations as De Gaulle put it, the fact that the EU was initiated and created by two american agents (Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann,) should tell us that EU was never designed to make Europe stronger but rather the opposite, I will agree that this brexit is a political demagogic scam, but I actually hope it will crush the european union (not europe, I believe it will be tough, but necessary to destroy this oligarchic tool)
0/0	EU is not there to govern its members and has never done so. There are rules and regulations agreed and voted by all representatives of the member states. The stupidity and EU hatred fed by the right wing press in uk is mind boggling. Incredible.

0/0	EU is the Best concept for Europe. An United Europe is good for the Europe and the World. If EU is gone...Russia and China will start their dirty game. So better that EU must exist.Sure it has some problems...but that can be Solved
0/0	EU is the worlds best alliance of western democracies and the best model ever invented for peaceful cooperation between countries in Europe and a better future for our great continent. Never before have people in Europe had such opportunities to influence Europe's development and future. Civil servants from all member states including UK meet every single day and work together to find solutions on issues of shared interest. Truly a people's participation project and genuine democracy. I am so thankful that my own children will remain part of the EU family and I truly wish UK would review rethink and remain. 🌸

1/1	EU is unreformable, EU is profligate, EU is undemocratic EU is over bureaucratic EU is divisive EU is not for us

1/1	EU isn't a good idea at any point.
0/0	EU isn't as bad as some people would like to believe. I admit, there were some mistakes that weren't handled well, migration crisis that went out of control, article 13 and other things. But it still is the best project that we've ever had as a whole Europe, for never before in the history of mankind have so many states united under one flag. EU is a child in its infancy, it makes mistakes, of course. But you do not kill a child because of a mistake. You teach from it, you adjust it and make it better.
0/0	EU isn't as bad as some people would like to believe. I admit, there were some mistakes that weren't handled well: migration crisis that went out of control, article 13 and other things. But it still is the best project that we've ever had as a whole Europe
1/1	EU just a signed deal with Japanesse. 50% biger than UK. EU will be just fine. Leave, we need move on. You can argue after, how long you fancy.

1/-1	EU lost almost 20 billion per annum
1/1	EU lost its great asset now that the UK has decicided to finally leave the failed EU after four decades of committed British membership that has been one of the EU strongest nations. The vote to leave the EU will release the UK from a highly demanding EU membership instead shifts into a total UK focus of efforts, Finances , resources and people that have been previously provided to the EU . The massive annual investments made by the UK can be available for Britains sole benefit which increases the British capabilities to tackle issues, produce wide ranging positive outcomes for British citizens and help the enhancement of uk society in many ways promoting better quality of life for all British people. The UK will also produce returns in benefits, needs meeting and advantages for all people in uk
1/-1	EU mad to have us back. If we go back in we'll tear it apart from the inside... because we're anti EU in its current form... happy to be friends and allies.. not happy to be in. If we end up back, then UKIP will become a very prominent party in the UK; cons will be destroyed.

1/0	EU mercifully invites war refugees to their lands, and in return these people repay their kindness with violence and mayhem. Most of the "refugees" appear to be war age single men. This entire situation is just unreal and it's almost tragic that people would dare call anyone who is not ok with this kind of behavior a "racist." What a lazy state of mind.

0/1	EU seems like they have got tired of out child like politics. Maybe we should of had a clear plan of leaving to show the voters before the vote. I am all up for a gamble at a blind auction, but its my money I could waste, not others.

1/1/1	Economics aside, brexit is a triumph for democracy in Britain
0/0	Economists are unanimous, and have been for hundreds of years, that free trade produces wealth, and tariffs and other barriers make everybody poorer. So if Britain leaves, tariffs will go up between Britain and the continent and Britain will be poorer. This is the main critique of Brexit.

1/1	Educate yourself about the EU..you may surprise yourself?....the EU is evil!
0/0	Eff reaching out to the world. Im voting remain because its pure common sense to do so. If we learn anything from this, it should be less reaching out to the undeserving and more reaching out to our own populace
0/0	Effects of Brexit struck home with reality today for our family. Brother in law, a hard working and productive professional got laid off. Uncertainty leaves bosses no choice but to cut back on costs so as to survive pending downturn caused by Brexit.
1	Eh? How does the EU keep it's cards to itself? Von der Leyen was apparently tweeting out that the UK would have to stick to EU standards for a trade deal. How is that keeping your cards close to your chest?

0/0	European nationalism and colonialism generated centuries of rivalry, conflict and war in Europe and in the world, causing millions of tragic and useless deaths. But now we know that sovereignty is not a fixed, static or immutable concept. It evolves and adapts, being totally able to accommodate a Sovereign Europe made of sovereign Member States. Only a strong European Union, based on human rights, democracy, free markets and the rule of law, can guarantee that Europeans are de iure and de facto sovereign in and over Europe and that Europe doesn't become a political and economic playground or battleground for non-European powers. It is sad to see the UK sowing those same old tragic and destructive seeds…

1/-1	Europeans are amused how easily the British public have the wool pulled over their eyes.
0/-1	Europeans now look at the EU like a sort of monstruos empire ruled by Germany(and they are not so wrong). To me, a European Union without UK is meaningless, I don’t want a sort of continental revival of the Holy Roman Empire
0/-1	Europeans' second language will normally ge English. That, in a nutshell, is a key driver of why the UK gets so many EU and non EU migrants
0/0	Europe’s links to America would become more tenuous. Above all, the loss of its biggest military power and most significant foreign-policy actor would seriously weaken the EU in the world.
1/1	Europe’s nations should be guided towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening

0/1/1	Even if the cost of brexit in Money was worth it (which won't happen) the uncertainty certainly wasn't worth it
1/1	Even if was possible to prove that Brexit would shrink the economy, I would still vote to leave because I value freedom and democracy over a little more wealth.

1/1	Every English person: yes we’ve finally left
0/0	Every UK citizen is poorer today. Because of brexit.
0/1	Every analysis I've ever seen on Brexit ignores a basic fact, which should be obvious to anyone within a day of visiting the UK. British people, before any rational argument about society and the economy, have a primal hatred for Europe (meaning continental Europe). This has been ingrained into society through centuries of having one continental power or the other be England's main rival. First the Spaniards, then the Dutch, then the French, then the Germans. There are generations alive today, who watched the UK fight Germany, win the war at the cost of their entire empire, and then watched Germany rise again and take over. The amount of resentment against German dominance in the EU cannot be understated. When you understand the above, you can begin to understand Brexit. You can understand why, after the vote, the greatest celebration wasn't for democracy or the economy, but for the fact that the EU would be unraveled. First and foremost, people who voted for Leave wanted to write the next chapter in their fight with Europe. You can now also begin to understand where the confirmation bias comes from, which enables them to believe that small advantages from Brexit will compensate for undoing the UK's biggest competitive advantage in the world economy.
1/1	Every country who joins the EU must handover their economic, soverign, social, judicial & democratic rights to an elitist, self serving corrupt federation run by Merkler!!
0/0	Every day Brexit reaches new levels of madness.
0/0/0	Every day I get angrier and angrier with Brexit enablers.
0/0	Every day that goes by Slowly remain seems to be the most sensible and obvious thing to do. Every day we are getting stronger and stronger in proving not on what we are saying but what reality is on the current world stage.
0/1/0	Every day we let this Brexit mess go on means less money being invested in the UK, fewer jobs being created and less tax revenue to pay for our public services.
0/0	Every day. And every time they try and justify it further, it makes me angrier. This is the single biggest fuck up by the government in my lifetime, will affect the entire country for generations and has zero possibility of anything positive coming from it. All we had to do, was remain. How can a government fuck up so badly and with so little regard for the consequences, even when they're staring you in the face?
0/0	Every empire has to hit that rock bottom sometimes. Good luck, UK people, brace for impact.

1/1	Every layer of "authority" over me and the one life I get is unwelcome. Brexit removes one layer.
1/1	Every member of the HoC who voted against Brexit or or Britain should be removed for treachery.That would get rid of about 75%.

1/1	Every negative commentator on Brexit (ie Remoaners who are dismissive of democracy) assume that damaging tariffs will be imposed on the UK. Why is that ? Why can we not set our tariffs to 0% and expect reciprocity from the EU ?
1/1	Every one needs to speak about what will happen if we stay in, the Lisbon 2022 treaty will see us lose the pound, Gibraltar and the Falklands, the stock exchange which will lose 200,000 jobs? What the hell are they trying to stay in for.
1/1	Every power the EU has is a power confiscated from you. #brexit
1/1	Every single Policy dreamed up by Adonis and implemented by Blair have been complete failures, even Adonis admits this and yet here we are having to listen to this dome headed failure lecture everyone on staying in the EU.
0/0	Every single person that I've talked to who supports the leave side has NO idea how the EU works or what it does for us. This vote showed the world just how stupid and gullible the British public can be - and here I thought we were better than the Americans.
1/-1	Every single remainer I’ve seen interviewed has said they’re sad to be leaving Europe. We. Haven’t. Fucking. Left. Europe! Europe is a continent. We can’t leave a land mass!
0/0	Every time I feel like giving up and saying “let them have their god awful Brexit”, some new hell or suffering emerges!
1/1	Every time I tell someone I voted out: There's at first a look of denial Then shock and disbelief Proceeded by a sceptical attempt to understand why Followed by some dooms day comments about the UK And then acceptance that the issue is not straight forward Most people didn't even know how the EU functioned politically when they voted, and still don't even know how it works now. I decided to look into it, and it's why, with a very, very heavy heart, I voted out. So, what exactly is the EU? As you know, it started off as mostly a free trade arrangement in order to promote peace (through economical interdependence). The UK opted in later, during the thatcher era! As time went on, it developed into a political union. Whilst not technically a federal union, it's pretty much heading in that direction. I'm not actually against that idea, I would like to see a fully democratic union. UEU or Europada? We could have a living wage across the EU which would solve many of the problems. So, what are the political structures and how do they work? There are three main ones with power: the Council, the Parliament, and the Commission. Council ("legislative body"): As I understand it, ministers from each country meet and can approve or veto legislation passed to them. For example, when trying to mandate free health care EU wide, all 28 (well 27 now) health care ministers would meet to approve laws). = something vaguely akin to senators in the US system. Parliament ("legislative body"): Every country elects representatives, the share of which depends on, of all things, treaties with your country. Like the council, this body approves/vetos legislation only. If they do not respond within enough time, the Council may bypass this body. = something vaguely akin to the house of Representatives in the US system. Commission ("executive body"): This is my favourite part of the EU (not!). This body is made up of 28 (now 27) appointed people, one for each country. How they are removed is not clear to me, if they even get removed at all. It's meant to be the EXECUTIVE body - think obama - but it is kind enough to handle creating all the legislation, trade deals and war/humanitarian decisions. At least it still needs to get legislation passed by the Council and maybe Parliament... which turns out not to be too hard when all your friends sit on the Council and the largest majority of representatives in the Parliament are, by treaty, German, French, Italy and Spain (Although the UK had a large chunk too to be fair). So yeah, our executive body seems to do, well, everything! And it's not even elected! The president of the Commission, who may as well be the president of the EU, is appointed by the 28 countries' leaders. (S)he has to negotiate with the country leaders for the appointed commissioners, but can assign them to whatever political roles s(he) desires. (S)he must be able to speak French (or France will shit a brick making life difficult for Germany). That limits our choice of president to France, Belgium or other vaguely French speaking countries in that area. What about the events happening in the news within the EU? A. Meanwhile, the situation in Greece is certainly frown worthy. Sure, the Greek government, and thus the people, mismanaged their finances. But to demand they make themselves so poor that young people end up sitting around jobless in their millions... I mean, do we really hate Greek people this much? There must be a better way. Greece cannot obviously devalue the euro to encourage tourism to help itself out of debt. We could subsidize it instead to make holidays artificially cheap there until their economy recovers, but the EU just won't go for that. Cos punishment is better I guess. B. Canada didn't originally want to allow Romanians and Bulgarians visa free access. Since the UK needs the EU to conduct trade deals with Canada, and trade deals must be approved unanimously by all 28 countries AND that neither Romania nor Bulgaria will agree unless Canada grants them visa free access - the UK was unable to ever establish a free trade deal. I think Canada recently agreed and will now allow the visa free travel. Thus, something that has nothing to do with trade had become a show stopper for everyone else, even countries outside the EU. C. Countries like Germany, France and even the UK enjoy cheap labour from the EU east for jobs that locals won't do for what is basically a nonsense wage for living in that western country. As things are much cheaper in the east, Eastern Europeans can easily send a small slice back to their families and it will mean a lot. I'm not against that in itself, but what I object to is that it hurts the local lower class workers in these western countries because if you live here and you're poor - who wants to work for minimum wage just to scrape by? Is it really that hard to understand why those we look down on as the thick, uneducated and lazy Brexiters are so angry by the situation? They themselves don't even understand the cycle that has been set up, but they just see that jobs they typically held have been replaced with immigrants. And hence it gives rise to xenophobia. D. Related to the last point, many Eastern Europeans, in return, enjoy the generous welfare benefits from these countries, able to send money back to their families even though they're not living in the UK and live in a country that has vastly different living costs. The problem here is that yet more money is pouring out of the country away from the UK rather unnecessarily. How is this a good thing for Britain? E. The EU has done a piss poor job of handling the refugee situation. Germany basically lead the EU into opening the flood gates without even consulting other countries. Many of the refugees are coming in from dire conditions to go onto waiting lists years long, as countries like Greece are already over burdened with debt. A proportion of the refugees are really just economic migrants from elsewhere than Syria - but the silly EU is doing nothing to filter them out, so they are contributing to the problem of the waiting lists and social resources etc, at the expense of genuine Syrians, and creating resentment of refugees. F. As for immigration, why has it worked so well in Canada and so badly elsewhere? Simple: If you don't have a decent education and clean criminal record, you aren't getting in to Canada! There's no immediate access to benefits (so you have to really want to move there for a better life) and if you commit a crime, you'll never get permanent residence or citizenship. This is how a nation of so much cultural diversity manages to exist in such a harmonious state. I'd love to see something like this in Europe, although we do need to clean our own house first, as it seems a good chunk of the EU is as thick as two short planks. How do I support such an idea in the EU? I have no democratic voice. And with a few unelected officials deciding to allow basically anyone in, on the basis that even mentioning the idea of a system like Canada's would amount to racism (a phenomena known as the "regressive left"), what choice do I have? My mother can no longer go out to her local shop 350m away from her house after 7pm because gangs of foreigners from somewhere in the EU patrol and mug people who go near. One can see incidences of mass rape in Sweden and Germany and yet the police do nothing out of fear of being seen as racists. You don't hear incidences like this in Canada. Fin I find what a lot of these leave supporters are doing to the large amount of good foreigners in the UK an absolute disgrace! It's disgusting. I have at least three friends living in London who are from the EU, I'd hate to think someone would abuse them the way I've seen abuse lately. It was also why I had such a tough time voting. I'm pretty much voting against their interests, my families interests, my country's short term economical interests... I studied the issue for probably 12 hours total, even on the day I wasn't sure, and I'm still not. But can you imagine the bottom of the unelected EU boot stamping on the face of the UK forever and ever? I'm just not sure it's something I can say yes to. The UK is gonna suffer a lot for a while. But I hope in the end the social, democratic and other problems get sorted. It's a risk I think is worth taking. Edit: Italics show where I edited to correct wrong information (currently: how the commissioners and president are appointed) Just to add: my main reason for voting out is solely the lack of democracy within the EU and the unwillingness to discuss things like free movement and immigration among the EU politicians. The only reason I critise immigration as it works in the EU currently is that as someone who now lives in Canada, I believe Canada has a better system of stricter immigration that has lead to a better society.
1/1	Every time Junkers and Tusk open their mouths it reaffirms the main reason I voted to leave
0/0	Every time someone says they're going to pull out, usually a baby is born. They'll be back. Lol
1/0/0	Everybody hates the EU, but the truth is we havent had a war between western european countries since second world war, that for me is the greatest achievement of the EU. Uk people think their lives are gonna improve with brexit, it's false, the conservatives only want to have more power to undermine the social state policies, and to launch UK in caothic neo-liberal rule, something that can't yet do under EU supervision( EU also wants to do the same but it's more difficult to do reforms with such a diverse variety of players, I mean the many different countries and political spectrum). If you think the EU is corrupt you should get interested and reform it from the inside so it benefits the common good. Just an opinion
1/1	Everybody survived before the EU, Britain will survive after the EU.
1/1	Everyday they care less and less about the world seeing the motives behind the eu. It's all about milking the cash cow.
1/1	Everyone I know is voting leave. Nobody in England likes David Cameron because he hates the poor and is a criminal. If there are more votes for 'stay' then I'm going to believe it's been rigged. Nobody I know wants David Cameron anywhere near power.
0/1	Everyone celebrating for this Brexit..wow, Hopefully Britain will be save from Thieves and Robbers, Because, everywhere polish, and Romanian people involved..what I've seen in the last five years, experience, has many proofs around us
0	Everyone deserves to be free! congratulations!
1/-1	Everyone forgotten how we stood alone in 2 World Wars.
1/1	Everyone in Ireland needs to know what @simoncoveney is planning with this #Ireland2040 crap. Planning to import a million people from Africa. And don't be fooled into thinking it's out of compassion. It's for profit. #Irexit should follow #brexit
0/-1	Everyone in Ireland wishes ya all the best.. we hope you enjoy “taking back control” and all those fun slogans.
1/1/0	Everyone is concerned about economy and probable consequences, while the principle that people is sovereign becomes a second option. This is how democracy is watered down till becomes worthless.
1/1	Everyone keeps saying it’s going to ruin their economy but have we seen that happen yet? I’m curious to see what actually happens as opposed to what people want to happen. The EU seems to have a lot to lose by losing the UK.
0/0	Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well.
1/1/1/1/1	Everyone knows that the EU is weak and is going to implode on itself very soon, it's better that we leave now than later.
0/0	Everyone looks on Britain, which was the country of a stable Parliament, with sheer horror and boredom
1	Everyone needs to look at 1972 pre single market, Britain had it's freedom was a major player in world trade and was at peace with the rest of Europe, travel the same as anywhere in the world, then we joined the single market, 1st thing food prices went through the roof, then we was rewarded with a luxury tax VAT, then bent banana's were banned, had to convert to metric....the list is never ending
1/1	Everyone seems to miss the point of brexit: the EU does not resemble a democracy and people want to change this.
1	Everyone should leave the European Union. After all, its nothing but a useless union serving no ones interests
1	Everyone that is against Brexit, should be moving.
0/0	Everyone who is a Leaver and is well off, claims to have done it for sovereignty. Everyone who is poor has claimed immigration as the main issue. Well- off people who are prepared to take a hit in personal finance do it so the majority, the other, live a better life. People who are poor and know that poor people will take the greatest hit, dont do it so others have a better life. They want others to have the same shitty life they have.
1/1/0/1	Everyone who thinks remaining in the EU is good for UK citizens should google "UK companies that has relocated using EU funding"
0/0	Everything about Brexit is needless, expensive, destructive and exactly what Putin wanted.
0/0	Everything about Brexit is stupid, needless, expensive and exactly what Putin wanted

1/1	Everything about the eu stinks rule britania rules the waves
1/1	Everything is caused by the Globalist including all wars for control everything is controlled. even news media that spread half truths and lies but people listen to all the rubbish that is sold to us every day..people must wake up open their eyes and see the real truth. the plan is to weaken each economy cause many problems then they take control of all countries through the corrupt EU Control system were they rule with their laws above all of us...
0/1	Everything that was ever promised in connection with Brexit: sunlit uplands, easiest deal in history, cheap shoes, £350m a week for the NHS, was a lie.
1/1	Everything we import why dont we try to make and export to the rest of the world, if we have to rely on other countries to function this country has been failing for years
1/1	Everything you write just vindicates our vote to leave. I hope we see a huge surge in anti eu populist parties in the coming european elections. Brexit is going to happen one way or another. The eu's approach of showing complete and utter contempt for its members and thinking it can just bully them into doing what it wants just shows why it has no future.
1/1	Everytime any of the EU leaders open their mouths. It just shows what a nasty bunch of power mad people they are. Desperate because they have been found out by people in the UK who wont stand for their elitism and want their soveriegnty back. They dont like the fact that they managed to convince other EU countries to change their minds on votes over things like the Euro and policy issues. Yet with the UK after nearly four years we have still stood firm.
1/1/0	Evidence that all the EU's "warm words" about still wanting to be "friends" are about as trustworthy as the legendary crocodile's smile! Our continuing frienddhip will be with the people of Europe, as ever, not the institution that we have just left.
1/1	Exactly - LEAVE should mean leave but we have a woman in charge who wanted to stay. It was staged from the beginning. Why do you think May was put in as PM in the first place. We do not count. She may state we are out (but doing deals with them, does not mean out in my opinion) and all the while she is pandering to Junker and his cronies and supporting remainers as well...... she is trying to make it look like she is supporting leave but she is trying to please everyone. The referendum was a 'farce' and waste of taxpayers money.
0/0	Exactly how I've felt every day since the referendum. My rights & opportunities & those of my kids are being torn away against our will. Am devastated at stupidity & arrogance of all those involved, & growing to hate my own country
1/-1	Exactly right, we've won one battle but there will be many more to come. It's no time to relax our guard.
0/0	Exactly the same reasons here. More money for public services and NHS? Yes! All of the campaign telling us they had plans for a smooth transition swayed me from voting stay and voting leave so the money could be better spent. Lies. All lies.
1/1	Exactly what we voted for..we never voted to be in the European Union.. only the common market.. now we're Free again
0/0	Exactly. Brexit has never stopped being the wrong decision. Just because MP’s are insisting on it doesn’t make it right, or mean that we have to endure it.
1/1	Excellent ! ...now all the useless EU bureaucrats & politicians will HAVE to actually work for a change in order to keep other countries from leaving as well.
1/1	Excellent Boris, at long last we have a Prime Minister that wants & will work to do what is best for our nation & citizens whilst also working with other nations. Thank you, we now have a positive future & also for future generation
1/1	Excellent I hope that this means that you lot will be replaced by some pro-british journalists and television show Runners maybe we'll actually get decent Doctor Who for a change
0/0	Excellent and true. Fuck farage... and trump by the way! Kind of good friends’ package, mmhh?
1/1/1/1	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
1/1	Excellent result. Loving all the leftist tears.
0/1/0	Excellent that Brexit is going to 'get done' at 11pm this evening and a new trade deal will definitely in place by December 2020 lol
1/1	Excellent! Well done Great Britain! Bright and better future ahead. More control over everything. It’s up to the government now to make the right decisions
1/1	Except now we have total and exclusive control over our political system. If people do truly want their rights they will vote for a party that will protect them. If not then they don't deserve them, simple.
0/1	Except that it's not one size fits all. That size didn't fit the UK, which wasn't part of the single currency, or Schengen. There are various models out there, from all-in (Eurozone and Schengen), the UK model (as was), or membership of the SM/CU but not the EU itself. The EU isn't a political power grab. It's the opposite. It allows me (for the time being at least) to up and leave any country in Europe whose politicians I don't like, and go and live in another one, no questions asked. It's amazing. Fair enough there's a big bureaucracy and some continent-wide rules to follow, but thse laws are just a substitute for national laws which would exist in their place. The nation state is an outdated concept.

1/0	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election
1/1	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election. This means that they obviously do not regret their vote to leave in 2016. And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists. So sad.
1/1/1/1	FANTASTIC we are LEAVING the CORRUPT EU.
1	FCK EU
0/0	FFS, if a country's currency devalues by 20% how can that be good for the economy? It shows a complete lack of faith by other countries in what you are doing.

0/0	Faced with a choice between simple and naive myths and complex and ambiguous reality, the choice for most people is easy.
0/0	Fact is Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist
0/0	Fact is Norway is not part of the EU and still they can't control the mass influx of immigrants. Same as Switzerland, destiny of many economic immigrants from Syria, etc.

1/1	Fact- Great Britain always wins in the end. Yes that's a universal fact.
0/0	Fact: People who say "leave means leave" with no further reasoning have no interest in preserving the UK, only destroying the current one.

0/0	Fear and anger whipped up a bogeyman that directed attention from the real problems. The EU was not perfect but there were benefits to being a member. Issues did exist but not the ones most people complained about. The issues most people had could have been fixed by our own government and the ones they were not concerned about could have been fixed while remaining a member of the EU. People are generally not interested in bureaucracy though, it is also easier for those in power to shape the country without EU supervision. It was easy for the media to manipulate people as a result. The pubic got what it thinks it wanted and those in power got what they really wanted.
0/0	Fear divide and rule. The whole country from bottom to top is antique.

0/0	Financial analyst Derek Matthews told us, “There are two types of people who loudly advocate for a no-deal Brexit, the very rich and the very stupid. If you’re not sure which one you are, take a look in your wallet.”
0/1	Financially the UK would be better off outside the EU
0/0	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid.
0/0	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid. Britain makes up about 5% of the EU's trade GDP. The EU makes up about half of Britain's trade GDP. So they must have unrestricted access to the European Economic Area or they're kind of screwed (i.e., suddenly have tariffs imposed on half their trade) Problem is, you still have to pay to access it if you leave so you don't have to pay EU membership fees. Other countries pay a huge chunk for this; equivalent to half or more of Britain's per-capita EU membership fees. And we haven't even started talking about the added costs of having to dish out farmer subsidies themselves instead of getting them from the EU. They're also screwing themselves over for a worse deal as well, if attempting to negotiate access to the EEA. Given the huge disparity in trading power between the EU and Britain, they (Britain) have no real leverage for negotiations. Furthermore, they'll probably generate hostility with the EU for abandoning them, so will probably face a much tougher negotiation than most other countries would.
0/0	Find it genuinely heartbreaking when older people of the country vote leave and it's not even their future. #VoteRemain
0/0	Find the silver lining. The brexiters will be screwed over more than we remainers. It's a toxic way of thinking but those idiots deserve everything coming their way if they haven't changed their minds yet.
0/0	Fine sweet words by Boris Johnson. Pity he doesn't mean a single syllable. Bit of a Tory tradition this, but as the old saying goes, 'fine words butter no parsnips'
1/1	Fingers crossed that we leave the EU in the morning then.
1/1	First - Why do the nations of Europe need each other so badly all of the sudden? France, England, Denmark, Spain, Italy (Rome), Germany and others practically ruled the world at one point or another in their history and in every case that was achieved while engaged in all out war with the other nations of Europe - not allied with them. Europe has become a sinking ship and England just got on the first life-boat. Second - I don't now how Vox and NPR listeners feel like they are superior intellectuals when you are spoken to like pre-teen children.

0/-1	First Darwin Award about to be given to a collective...
1/-1	First I would laugh for a good few minutes. Then I would be relieved.
0/1	First Scotland or Northern Ireland will leave the uk followed by the other in both cases to get into the EU then after a decade or so London and the south east will tire of subsidising the rest of England and secede to become a city state within the EU. What will brexitland do then?
1/1	First and foremost I voted 'Leave' for freedom as against 'Remain' in captivity. There is and never was any need for a trade deal.
0/-1	First for the sake of democracy, when can we see the RUSSIAN report.
0/0	First of all, I want to say that English isnt my native language, so sorry for the mistakes. For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist? Of course you can be proud of your country, but thinking It is the best in the world and that its habitants are superior to other people...that is absolutely anachronistic. Why dont we focus in what we have in common? We all are humans, we should stop hating each other and start helping each other. You may say I dont know how world goes and that It is impossible, but like gandhi said "be the change you want to see in the world". If you travel (at least in other Europe countrys) you will realize we are the same. I remember a picture of Merkel hugging Holland when the terrorist attack in Paris took place. That picture was very meaningful, because France and Germany have been in war the XIX and the XX century, and now they are two countrys in peace, helping each other. I think is easier to believe that things can change instead of hating everything. By last, I will love to think that Europe is only the begining, that we are going to just one nation, a global one. That is extremly hard to reach, so right now I'm content with making Europe a country. (Of course I know It has some things bad, and I want a well built Europe)
1/1/-1	First of all, as a European from the mainland I'm glad about Brexit. Finally we got rid of the UK! However, the Scots are always welcome back! As independent Scots, that is.
1/1	First stop the endless defense ATL of the ideology of Islam, otherwise your are fakeliberals.
0/0	First world countries politics crazier then ever
1/1	Firstly I think the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic organisation. I've yet to meet a single voter of any colour who can give a reasonably honest and accurate explanation of how the core EU institutions function in practice
1/1	Fisheries must be controlled by Britain, I know the Dutch are worried about it, what they dont understand is that the British industry was one of the largest in the world, it has been decimated by the EU. We want it back at any expense
0/0	Fishing contributes about 1% of our economy. Only brexiteers would be stupid enough to value fishing over our services sector which makes up 80% of the economy.
0/0	Following the Brexit virus spreading uncontrollably throughout the UK, bozo decides to import more viral ideas ?
1/1	Following three years of turmoil, the UK is likely to have the most stable political environment in Europe for the next
1	Fool Britannia. Good luck.
0/1	For 16 months, I lived in the European Union. That was cool. Now I live on an island in the Atlantic. #Brexit #UK #Scotland
0/0	For Brexiters it's all about fear and identity. Insecure numpties.
0/0/0	For British citizens the British passport is the only one option for travel abroad. British passport is no longer recognised as EU travel document. You will loose all rights over EU and that is the decision of British people. They decided to become 3 party citizens to be independent.
0/0	For Johnson, Gove, and the rest, it's now all quiet on the Brexit benefits and assurances front. All the promises are forgotten. It's simply doing the will of the people. Thier attempt to escape blame will rightly fail.
1/1	For Justice - Vote Leave!
1/1	For a country to be strong and successful it must make their own decisions. The UK by living the EU will be once again a country of leadership and respect. Congratulations UK.
0/0	For a country with almost no natural resources, a need to heat in the winter, and not enough food grown for the population, the future looks... interesting.
0/0	For a nation that prides itself on its football, this is the mother of all own goals. Good work you muppets.
1/-1	For a start BBC, you can drop the EU bias, secondly, reintroduce free licenses for the over 75s, get rid of Lineker, and all the rest of the presenters with over inflated ego's, and return to pre 1973 broadcasting. When our beloved Auntie was always warm and comforting to have around. If you are not careful, you will be binned by many disgruntled listeners and viewers!!
1/1	For all those who love the EU so much and are afraid of governing ourselves which we did for at least a thousand years, the solution is simple, move to Europe. DONT drag us down with your idiotic politics.
0/0	For anyone arriving from Europe into the U.K. from 1st Feb, remember you’ll need to adjust your watch for the time difference. We’re now about 30 years behind
1/1	For better or worse EU law no longer applies in the UK. And we have regained sovereignty.
0/0	For example the EU has over 100 free trade laws with other nations. It would take us well over a decade to become as free as the EU currently is.
1/1	For gods sake , why have they waited for over two years for this possibility ! Even the PM said NO DEAL is better than a BAD DEAL ! And I didn't vote for a deal ! I voted LEAVE !
0/0	For goodness sake see some common sense and cancelled Brexit before the country ends up bankrupt
1/1	For heavens sake : GO AND VOTE if you want Brexit to happen!
1/1	For industry, one of the worst aspects of the EU is their obsession with achieving consistency across all member states. Unfortunately this can rarely be achieved by raising standards appropriately across the board, so instead, European standards have to set at a low/average level, to suit the weaker players. For example, when the EU introduced mortgage regulation, this took the UK mortgage industry back at least a decade, with no possible benefits emerging for UK customers. (It was the technological equivalent of ruling that all mortgage lenders had to use Windows 98.) Yet the UK banks had to comply, and pay millions to change their systems and processes (a pointless expense, which the banks duly passed onto UK mortgage customers). Of course, the new mortgage regulation was deemed a success by the EU: its objective of introducing a level playing field across all member states was achieved, by bringing all European lenders down to the Lowest Common Denominator. Is it any wonder that none of the world’s top tech companies are from the EU? So glad we’re out...
1/-1	For many euro-skeptics, it’s a sign that maybe leaving the EU isn’t such a good idea. For pro-europeans, it’s a sign that the will of the people can no longer be done without. This should encourage both sides to more constructive criticism and reform of the EU rather than radical dogmatism, and that’s excellent.
1/1	For me a leave vote will be my choice. I'd like to have more control over the policies in the UK and who we elect. Id rather not have 12 rich democrats decide what each country needs and what it doesnt. The European economy is on a decline at the moment and with Eurozone bailouts ahead it's more money we need to shell out for nothing. They say we'll have a louder voice in the European Union after this should we vote stay but with another 5 potential nations joining does that not dilute your voice even more? Then there's the murder of Joe Cox, I can't help but feel they're using this in favour of the stay campaign trying to make a martyr out of her and making you feel in a sense a murderer.
1/1	For me it is not about immigration, it's not about the economy, it's about democratic accountability. The EU is anti-democracy.
1/0	For me it was all about sovereignty, the ability to make our own decisions and not be ruled by the faceless, non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels; not to be frogmarched into ever greater political union and the creation of a European superstate which no one ever sought my opinion over. It was about regaining control over our own borders and regaining a say into our own destiny. It was also about uncontrolled migration, but never about the economy. I never believed “project fear”, and if the economy does falter, now we have regained control of our country we can make decisions and take action ourselves to rectify it. An independent Britain that trades and lives peacefully with its European neighbours, but is not ruled by them. One that listens to the needs and opinions of the ordinary people and not just those of the white, middle class, liberal elite in London. As an older member of the population, I also resent the current ageist view being peddled by remain voters that my vote to leave was somehow selfish and of less value than those of a young person, and that I should have thought of their future. I did think of their future, it was just a different future I saw; one living in a free, independent nation, able to make its own decisions unencumbered by Brussels. Just because I am older, my opinion is to be ignored or seen as being of less worth. You could say that as I have worked for over 40 years, paid more into society than any young person I therefore have more at stake to lose. My opinion is far more valid.
1/1/1	For me it was trade. The UK is the most globalised country in the world. We have have more direct investment from abroad than anywhere else. The Chinese businessmen, the Russian Oil Tycoons, the Arab Sheikhs have been buying up property and businesses in the UK for the last 10 years at breathtaking speed. It's seen as a safe and growing option. We are afterall the fastest growing G7 nation. Switzerland has a grand total of 27 Free Trade Agreements with 38 of it's trading partners. The EU has managed to sign just 4 so far. The EU with it's 28 voices and red tape makes negotiating deals a slow and tiring process. No wonder the Swiss enjoy such High Per Capita wages and great quality of life. Remember they are a landlocked nation surrounded completely by EU member states. If they can do it with the 8 million population. Then the UK with it's 65 million population, 5th largest Economy, and Rank 1 of the G7 growers definitely can. The future is bright. The future is Britain at the forefront of a Globalised world.
1/1	For me it's simple. The UK is very different from Europe; in every respect. The happiest and most prosperous countries in Europe include Switzerland and Norway; both non EU countries. Britain had to sever ties with the Commonwealth as a condition of joining the EU. Sounds like shackles went on to me. We've tried becoming European. We haven't and resist at every turn. To prosper and be happy; leave the EU
0/0	For me personally, I think that a leave vote would be awful for UK science. I'm a PhD student in Chemistry, and my research group is about 60-40 UK-'foreign' workers. We're funded by a Wellcomme trust high level strategic grant, so pretty important research. We have people from Hungary, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. It's the same throughout the University. Leaving the EU would directly impact our ability to recruit top talent, and which would in turn reduce our ability to produce high level research - one of the UK's strengths.
1/1	For me there are 3 main issues. First is democratic accountability - the fact that the majority of power within the EU lies in the hands of unelected commissioners. Second is economic - we are unable to negotiate our own trade deals and are forced to apply legislation such as the common external tariff, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. As the only EU country that does more trade outside the EU than inside it, we are disproportionately hammered by the EUs protectionist approach. 3rd is legal. The UK is tradationaly a common law jurisdiction whereas the EU is a civil law institution. Generally, I am in favour of limited, localised and highly accountable government subject to the rule of law. The EU is in many ways the antithesis of that.
0/0	For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist?
0/0	For me, the most obvious thing that would happen if we came out of Europe (assuming Cameron gets his treaty changes and then holds a referendum, of which I am doubtful) is that it would almost inevitably mean closer ties to the USA. I don't want that.
0/0	For most Brexit voters the poll was nothing more than an outlet to express their bigotry and their xenophobia.
0/0	For most people Brexit will mean a poorer quality of life due to a higher cost of living with prices rising due to inflation and a weaker trade deal or no deal at all.
0/-1	For my birthday this year I got #Brexit. If I don't get my mad superpower like those kids in Midnight's Children pretty soon, then I will not be happy. Because, so far, all it has brought me is a lot of paperwork. #BrexitDay
1/1	For once the little guy won omg
0/0	For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together
0/0	For our next trick we'll shoot ourselves in the face instead of the foot
0/-1	For remainers that means embracing the opportunities and for leavers understanding Brexit is not an end in itself.
1/1	For some of us Brexit is about not giving up our power and law to Europe, not having a European army controlled by one political power, not paying huge amounts of money into a European pot.... it was never about race or who was deemed as belonging just us choosing who crossed our borders for our own safety and security and the security of all Europeans within our borders
1/1	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave.
1/1	For the UK, it was the right strategic call
0	For the benefit of those who think No Deal means we stay as we are, it doesn't, it means we leave the EU on the worst possible terms with the worst possible outcome. If you want to stay as we are then you want no brexit.
1/1	For the first time ever, in my view, the arguments for us breaking ties with Brussels are looking more appealing.
1/1/1	For the first time in 37 years the UK can be a UK!! A sovereign nation with its own laws, Monarchy , Parliament and endless opportunities for growth. An opportunity to grow manufacturing in the UK. GREAT TIMES A HEAD. The pound has not sunk. The sky has not caved in !!
1/1	For the first time in a long time I feel proud to be British
0	For the first time in history Britain took the wrong decision leaving Britain the underdog reluctantly conceding leadership to France and Germany like USA concedes global leadership to China/Russia alliance and decide to be the new axis of evil.
1/-1	For the first time in history, Britain has decided to leave on its own
0/1	For the first time in history, Britain took the wrong decision, leaving Britain the underdog, reluctantly conceding leadership to France and Germany, like USA concedes global leadership to China/Russia alliance and decide to be the new axis of evil.
0/0	For the first time in my life i am legitimately frightened about the future
1/1/1	For the informagtion of that Dutch girl I voted Brexit not because of some newspaper story but because I know what the EU is.
0/-1	For the people of Britain it's simple. If everything wrong in this country is the fault of the EU, then leaving will prove that. On the other hand, if we start to slide into the abyss, then it will be obvious that it is our own politicians who are to blame. So the people will get to know who's exactly to blame in due course.
0/0	For those Brexiteers complaining about the EU, please don’t forget that you voted for this so please stop moaning about a situation you helped create.
0/0	For those Brexitors, please don't count your chickens just yet. Only time will show you the real consequences of your decisions.
0/0	For those Brits who got their wish, I hope you get exactly what you feel you deserve, no more, no less. For the rest, I wish you the best under your new circumstances, especially those in the fields of science and technology who thrive on collaboration and cooperation. No nation is an island, not even the U.K.
1/1	For tonight the U.K. is building up its flood defences to cope with the amount of remain saltiness flowing at 11pm. Happy Brexit Day🇬🇧
1/1	For us it was what we voted for and was not a mistake. For the EU it was a mistake because if they had given a little something to David Cameron then I have no doubt we, the UK would have voted to remain. Thank god they did not give us anything!
1/1	For wealthy countries, such as the UK, the cost of being a member of the EU is greater than the benefits
1/1	For what we sell to Europe it will be a very rewarding time for Great Britain to have a World wide market without the EU
0/1	Forced to accept EU laws? The UK are non-signatories of many EU schemes and legal frameworks like the Euro and Schengen area. As for the European Convention of Human Rights, this has been abused of late due to political correctness but it was a British construct and does provide several important protections
0/0/0	Forever divided, we leave. So sad. To the elderly, I say "We cannot believe you would throw your children under the bus." But you did.We will deal with the mess. Thank you
0/0	Forget drops. Drop BREXIT. Best bet for Britain is to stay with the EU.
0/0	Forget the markets. London will plunge into a deep recession if brexit passes, it will be worse than the one that hits the countryside.
0/0	Forgive me but I feel the fight has now gone beyond flippant humour. The UK is in serious deep shit with Brexit
1/1	Former Remainers are most definitely now argueing for ’soft brexit’ as a way to subvert the democratic decision of June 23.
1/-1	Former top judge calls for fundamental review of politics post- Brexit.
0/0	Fox describes no deal as “survivable “. Not exactly glowing with confidence. A nuclear bomb is survivable , cancer is survivable as are most car crashes.
0/0	Fox news supports it Ok now i'm worried
1/1	France has accepted we're leaving and is preparing for a No Deal exit. So should we. Let's get on with it. No Deal, no problem
1/1	France is the next! EU is a failure proyect we are worse than in the past
1/1	Frankly I am amazed that these MPs are still walking about freely without massive protection after what they are doing!Its called treason!
1/1/1/1/1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
1/1/1	Frankly we need to disband any type of government body that attempts to set laws for multiple countries, like the EU and the UN, we need to let countriemen decide what goes on in their own country
1/1	Free at last ,free at last , thank god almighty free at last ...
1/1	Free at last, Free at Last...
1/1/1	Free at last, free at last, praise God almighty they're free at last!
0/0	Free from what? Free to do what?
0/0	Free movement has shown to be very good for both businesses and academia. It introduces diversity in approaches and ways of thinking, encouraging innovation and creativity, as well as business growth. An internationally acclaimed economy, needs international input if it is remain at the forefront of the world stage.
1/1	Free of the shackles of the corrupt anti democratic EU at last. Hopefully more member states will follow the UKs lead and bury the bloc for good.
1/1	Free to do what we want to do. Yippee
1/1	Free to set our own laws, Brexit should act as a catalyst for a new era of prosperity for an outward-looking U.K. ambitious in removing barriers to trade, enterprise and economic growth.
1/1	Freed from restraints in Europe, Britain could rebuild ties with natural English-speaking allies in the Commonwealth and strengthen the Special Relationship with the United States.
1/1	Freedom U K

1/1/1	Freedom for the People, we are now a Sovereign Nation again!!!
1/1	Freedom from petty, foreign, unelected, pathetic politicians, EU rules, regulations, controls and inward-looking socialist, neo-progressive, liberal Europeans. I'm good with that.
0/1	Freedom is good. Enjoy!
1	Freedom is what it's about. F the EU.
0/1	Freedom of movement from the Islamic world to Europe? If Europe wants to collapse borders within Europe it needs to secure borders around Europe.
1/1	Freedom of movement must be great for security.
1/1	Freedom of movement should be the first thing we stop!!!
1/1	Freedom over fear! Brexit now!
0/0	Freedom requires morality and a sense of common purpose. The UK doesn't have that anymore.
1/1	Freedom self determination
0/0	Freedom to trade outside the EU sounds great in theory but in practice I imagine it will be much harder than any Brexiteer cares to admit.
1/1	Freedom, Independence, National Sovereignty, Democratic Accountability: These things are much more worthy preserving and important than any possible, temporary economic disturbance or loss!!!
1/1	Freedom, sovereignty, self-determination. The biggest day in British history since the end of World War Two, and a huge victory for liberty
1/1	Freedom 😀

1/1	From 2021, UK citizens and interests will be represented by... UK citizens.
0/0	From Europe mainland point of view, the Brexit situation looks quite hilarious. Now, Corbyn has a good opportunity to become next UK's PM
1/1	From a Europeans point of view (who lived in UK for 15 years ) I really wish the UK would leave
0/0	From a different perspective, I am a Welsh nationalist and will be voting to Remain because Wales would be on the brink of an economic collapse if we leave the EU. We get significantly more out of the EU than we put in, purely financially, and I have no faith whatsoever in the UK Government to replace that funding. We get so much out of the EU because we have some of the highest poverty levels in the whole of Europe - the London-centric UK Government seemingly has no interest in rectifying the structural reasons for Wales' poverty and poor economic performance. Alongside that, I think the EU is fundamentally a force for good in the world. Freedom of movement and a peaceful, stable Europe are two achievements that cannot be underestimated, and although I do not agree with everything the EU stands for (TTIP, for example, is a nightmare) I want Wales to play its part in it. Regardless of the way the UK votes on Thursday, my long term aim is for Wales to be a Member State of the European Union in its own right.
0/0	From having control of our borders To not having control of our borders #Madness Need a #PeoplesVote And prosecution to #Brexiteers who lied, misled and damaged our nation.
0/0/0	From here it seems like Britain is screwed, and I just keep wondering why those people are doing that to themselves.
0/0	From now on, Brits are no longer EU citizens. They've lost all the rights, protections & benefits that come with EU membership. Half a billion neighbours have those rights. But UK Leavers have sold ours for a blue passport and a 50p piece.
0/0	From the French, we urge you to remain! Would you rather listen to Farage and Boris or the leading economists and world leaders?
1/1	From the Netherlands: Congratulations with your regained freedom. Tonight you will be free of EU slavery!!!!!

0/0/0	Fucking stupid, the last spiteful act of a generation of geriatric Little Englanders, abetted by the venal incompetence of the Conservative Party. But I think we're stuck with it now and calls to reverse the decision are pointless. Likely outcome is a few years in the wilderness, then if the EU is still around 10-15 years from now we'll meekly rejoin.
0/0	Fucking worse, its unlikely we will remain in the single market which is going to make it far harder to travel to Europe, like Trumpageddon its empowered the alt-right scum who are now ramping up racist and homophobic agendas in the place.
0/1	Fuk old its our time we need to decide wat our future will be they had there time wich they enjoyed going around EU
0/0	Fun fact: If Brexit meant that Britain would be taking more migrants in than before 95% of leave voters would’ve voted remain. Why? Because the main reason for the idiots who still think Brexit is a good idea is those who only voted out because Nigel Farage promised fewer migrants never mind the benefits that where also promised like the millions that would go to the NHS which was like many others a load of BS. No intelligent Brexit voter would still be sticking to Brexit.
1/1	Fundamentally I don't want Britain to be part of a European political union, and don't trust our political class to keep us from further integration. I didn't see Remain as anything more than a temporary "status quo" option and our apparent "opt out" from ever closer union wasn't worth the paper it was written on.
1/1	Funny I saw a poll in last week’s DT that quoted 58% now want to leave. And by the way child, not leaving is illegal.
0/0	Funny how Brexiters always talk about fishing and never about farming and agriculture once we come out of the transition we are now in.
1/1	Funny how it couldn't be done according to Eyore and Treason May. Well done Boris!
0/0/0	Funny how little the media has ever bothered to examine the perspectives of the other EU nations in all this. It's all about what's good or bad for us,nobody seems to give a shit what harm it may do to our friends and neighbours.
1/1	Funny how the EU are now starting to ask us for things... how the tables have turned
1/1	Funny how the leavers are called the racists when it's us who want to engage with the rest of the world rather than just white Europe.
1/-1	Funny how the vote remains never have British accents .
1/1	Funny isn't it, we were told by politicians and experts we were going to have emergency taxation if we voted Brexit because of uncertainty. In three and half years of Brexit uncertainty, Britain is booming and EU are in recession.

1/1	Germany have finally taken over Europe but they didn’t have to kill a single person this time. Very impressive. GET ME OUT!
1/-1	Germany will continue to be the dominant power in Europe
1/1/1	Germany will quickly discover that it was actually the British, not the French, who were their strongest allies in the EU ... at least on the free trade front. Other than Germany with its export-oriented economy, the remaining EU countries that support free trade are actually tiny, import-dependent countries. Other than France, the remaining "large" countries in the EU are depressed basket cases like Italy and Spain, while the rest of the EU is former communist countries hungry for development funds but otherwise hostile to the entire thing.
0/0	Germany won. Britain is lost some fools even reminded ''rule Britania'' while no more colonies to exploit, no natural resources or big industries. Its byebye little Britian.

1/1	Getting Brexit done, in the sense of leaving the European Union was, in a way, the easy bit
1/1	Getting out of the EU can be quick and easy – the UK holds most of the cards
0/0	Gibraltar, Scotland, Ireland all voted to stay in the EU. They should be allowed to stay. England will be the nation that breaks the UK apart.
0/0	Give it a few months until the consequences of leaving the EU start to sink in. For example, the British immigrants living in Europe who voted to end their own freedom of moment, their access to free healthcare and the loss of their pension rights. Being a third country is not going to be a whole heap of fun especially when the expats all start moving back to Blighty! Where are they all going to live?
0/0	Give it up. It's a bad deal. After they first voted on the referendum, what was it 3 years ago, most people now think it was the wrong thing to do and they are against it.
0/1	Give me one reason why we would suffer hard from it. With Brexit Britain can have a much better future.
1/1	Give the EU an invoice for the infrastructure we funded and will leave behind. Gott in himmel they are so arrogant. Do not answer the phones for a month after Freedom Day.
1/1	Give the EU nothing!!!!!!!!!!
1/1	Give the EU the big middle finger by calling President Trump and hammering out a deal within a week.
1/1	Give the above, stopping Brexit simply is not an acceptable democratic option
1	Give the whiny 48% what they want and let's be the Social Justice Soviet Union.
1/1	Give them a one way ticket to Brussels if they want to stay in. Simples!

1/1	Give us our country back is all we want and voted for
1/1	Give us what we voted for, No Deal WTO actual Brexit
1/1	Given that i know nothing at all about trade and commerce, i can say that i do know about what it is that i and 17.4 million voters want at this particular time in our history, and that is--TO LEAVE THE EU.
0/1	Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run.
1	Given the right to - given the opportunity to vote, I voted for Brexit because I've never approved really of the European Union, I never approved of it because of its attempts to confiscate national sovereignty in all the issues that matter.
0/-1	Glad I'm not the only one who thinks brexit sounds like a breakfast cereal
1/1	Glad the people who live there got a say in what happens to their country. I would have voted to leave if I lived there, so I agree with their vote. But I'm not a citizen there so my opinion does not matter.

1/1	Globalism is slavery, central banking, common currencies, centralized government, corporate collusion in politics, flooding Europe with immigrants who detest our way of life, divide and conquer, order and enslavement out of chaos. Doesn't anyone understand the end game? The UK will bounce back economically in three weeks. This decision is historically the beginning of the end of Globalism. Be proud of it.

0/0	God to be able to go back to the days when the worst thing a politician could do to this country was the inelegant consumption of a bacon sandwich.
0/0	God you Brexiters talk shite. It's like some induced dream you all live in, which is why the divisions brewing in this nation will only worsen.
1/1	God, it makes me so happy to see true, patriotic Brits (and non-Brits) rebutting this buffoon and his platitudes, and backing Brexit. Brexit is the only way we can save our country from the globalist nightmare that awaits Europe. Controlling immigration, being sovereign, trading with the world and rejecting cultural Marxism are all things to be proud of, and things any sane person wants - these things will be achieved with a Brexit vote.
0/-1	Goes on march to show just how WOKE and PROGRESSIVE you are to your friends and family. Throws rubbish in the street for someone else to clean-up. Imagine my shock.

0/0	Good Job Guys!!! now £ = $
1/1	Good Lord! It's not a German cartel, it's a Jewish cartel! The same Jewish banking/corporate cartel that has started all European wars for the last two hundred years. For God's sake wake up already!
0/0	Good Lord! Just STOP BREXIT! It’s painfully obvious that it’s the right thing to do! Enough already! Why must a democratic, free thinking people hurl themselves over a cliff? Mature adults can see that a course needs to be changed, once circumstances change, and once data proves that it was not a good idea. They just say: “On second thought, NO - based on what we know now, and where we are.”
0/-1	Good Luck! From now on all that happens is your responsibility. Do not blame the EU for negotiating hard. Take the consequences for the outcome and own it, hardship included. I do hope it works out for the EU block of 27 nations and the UK. And welcome back...always !

Snouts in the taxpayer trough. They realise the lies at least, a bit late. "Get out, repair the country" ..... Fair enough. Leaving the EU will not solve the UKs demons which centre on class system and massive inequity. These people need to have a good look at Mogg Farage and Johnson. These people are rich and disingenuous, scum. I understand the disillusionment. Terrible.

1/1	Good to see some of the younger generation took the time to even vote, Remain or Leave. I voted leave. I couldn't see anything more illogical than the EU unelected, self appointed committee members & presidents casting their personal opinion over the wills of the people. No matter what country you are from. It should always be down to the Sovereign Nation/People to decide what laws to pass & how to conduct themselves, their culture & way of life.

0/0	Great Britain is heading where they've been heading for hundreds of years - down the drain. In the empire where the sun used to never set, they've hammered one of the final nails into their own coffin and the hole keeps getting deeper. Right-wing-nut philosophy is working really well isn't it? The problem is, most of the advocates of this "me vs. the rest of the world" philosophy are not intelligent enough to realize that all the trouble-makers now and in history have worked their magic with a perverted sense of the very same mindset.
1/1	Great Britain is more than just a star on someone else's flag
1/0	Great Britain is much different than the rest of Europe. An economy is much more than the currency or gold. economy encompasses culture and many other things. It makes sense for UK to be independent and deal with their problems; not be bogged down by mainland regulation and problems.
0/0	Great Britain is now Little Lonely Britain.
1/1	Great Britain is very smart to Brexit !!!!
1/1	Great Britain was a great country, before they joined the EU. They will be a great country when they leave. Sure, you'll have to disentangle yourselves, set up new trade agreements, but the benefits, are awesome. You'll govern yourself, austerity will end. No one will dictate to you, from a foreign country. A lot of Americans look up to you, for your bravery, and agree with you, for your ideals.
1/1/1	Great Britain was once a great empire. Don't let the EU drag you down
1/1	Great Britain we love you and now even more that great Britain will be independent country
1/1/1	Great Britain will be great Britain again woooooooohoooooo
1/1	Great Britain will do just GREAT now they are out.
0/0	Great Britain will soon be no more, the fragmentation has already started and eventually lonely England will be assimilated as a new state of the USA.
0/0	Great Britain, at 11pm tonight please remember to set your clocks back to 1972.
0/0	Great Britain. You've thrown your one future into the trash pit. You left the union your entire economy growth is based on. Now the EU only has to make one single sanction against you and you're DESTROYED. But then again, I'll laugh at you when you'll run back to the EU in a few years and kneel down to them asking if they could rejoin.

1/1	Great for the UK on leaving the globalist elite union! The Revolution is starting! Great job UK!
0/0/0	Great idea guys! How about we all come together and share resources and knowledge, have free and easy trade and travel between countries and the ability to live where we like and all without losing control of our own laws and borders and having a veto on any laws introduced by this organisation? Wait that's what we had? So why have we left? Oh yeh: "brexit means brexit"... Well that's ok then..
1/1	Great idea. Hope the UK gets out. Why should they support several of the loser countries who are part of the EU?
1/1	Great job Boris.
1/1	Great job Brits! Take your country back! If only us "Yanks" could take ours back too....

1/1	Great night had by patriots, keep the English flag flying high
1/1	Great result. UK has sacrificed itself to allow the other european nations to use the leave excuse as blackmail to change things into the union. Thanks UK, your sacrifice will not be forgotten.

1/1	Great write up and every bit true. I am on holiday in Grand Canaria at the moment staying in a hotel with Germans french fin's Italians and Spanish all very friendly and they are asking about Brexit all who I have spoken to are very envious and think we will do extremely well.
0/0	Great, not only will the tourist industry in Britain be hurt by Brexit, the entire British travel industry might perish because no one will dare to order any tickets .. well played.
1/0	Great. :/ now everything is going to shitt.
0/0	Great. I don't give a shit about hanging on to tenuious lines that cavemen drew out on a map. The idea we need to remain an independent country is naive and stupid.
1	Greatest day in a long time. Globalists are being destroyed everywhere! Congratulations patriots!
1/1	Greece has become a case study of how the EU can destroy a country. It should be taught in universities. It is dreadful to see what is happening.
1/1	Greeting from Finland! I believe in you UK, vote against continued inefficient rule of the incompetent bureaucrats in Brussels, vote leave! If your nation manages to leave this crony establishment, other countries like mine will have a better chance to do so as well. Good luck, and godspeed!
0/0	Grievance politics swung the EU referendum to a leave vote. Now we are about to find out what a mistake that was.
1/1	Grieve and the remainers want to drag it on until 2021 so that we have to participate in EU Elections, it brings in rafts of EU Legislation and allows for the EU to draft more! Most 'migrants' will have become EU citizens through residence rules allowing them EU passports and they STILL want freedom of travel! On yer bike! OUT, RIGHT OUT, NOW!
1	Growing up without being surrounded by other cultures seems like heaven to me.

1/1	Had the "Elites" known, the peasants would vote to LEAVE, they never would have agreed to allow the referendum. Now it's time, to let your MPs know, in no uncertain terms, that your country is leaving, with or without them.
1/1	Haha so funny not... remainer moron you're a joke please move to a cucked EU country not many of those left while you can your globalist dream ( nightmare ) is over and you can't do anything to change that.
0/0	Haha, gonna be fun to watch the island sink while the rats are clapping their own doom...
0/0	Hahah that is hilarious. The UK must be about to discover some new industry that everyone is going to want and cannot replicate. The UK has been in steady decline for a long time, isolating itself through Brexit will just increase the pace of decline. They will be begging india for help soon. Hilarious..... oh the humiliation they will feel

I am educated, I listen to James O'Brien on LBC between 10am to 1pm every day, so I know what I am talking about. Please vote for the person who is most likely to beat the Torries in you area. I am back Jeremy as he is my local MP and hopefully soon to be prime minister under a Lib Dem - Labour coalition. With the lib Dems on board we will, together stop this madness and reverse the mad decision made last June. We can then begin to rebuild this once beautiful loving country. #Make June the end of may!

0/1	Happy trip back to the middle ages England
1/1	Happy. Satisfied.
1/1	Hard Brexit is better than being enslaved by the EU rules and regulations without a say. No taxation without representation. The EU will allow trade within a few months after their businesses realized that they lost 66 million customers.

0/0	Hardcore Brexiters will never be happy. They have Johnson in No 10, Trump in the White House, the UK is leaving the EU by law ... and they're still whining and complaining. Currently about a bell. They will never stop whining and complaining and playing the victim card. It's just who they are.
1/1/0	Harder times for the EU having to survive on 8 Billion euros less that the UK currently contributes to their budget
0/1	Hardline #Brexiteers searching for alternative to #Backstop #BrexitShambles
1/1	Has anybody else noticed that, although the BBC and others are happy to talk to both sides of Conservative MPs, the only Labour MPs they speak to are those who are in favour of staying in Europe (Yvette "I will take in a migrant family but haven't got round to it yet" Cooper being the lastest)? I don't believe for a second that all Labour MPs are in favour of remaining in yet that's the impression we are given. Their leader was in favour of withdrawal in 1975 yet tries to say that he wants to remain in yet his speech was hardly a ringing endorsement of continued membership - more "I suppose that we better had" rather than "It's in our best interests to stay". It's impossible to say where the economy will be next year, never mind in 14 years time so this is yet another scare story from the pro EU lobby. We have had two pro EU leaflets through our door so far - both have gone unto the recycling bin unread.
0/0	Has anyone considered what the EU would be like if the UK became a proactive EU member instead of just moaning about cucumbers and immigrants? As the article points out the majority of immigrants are from outside the EU which is a bit inconvenient and cucumbers - Jesus. For me, the best things about the EU are freedom of movement, the near impossibility of major war and the security it brings by being part of 450m people. How can you put a price on that?
0/0	Has anyone found the list of real benefits we are going to get from Brexit yet?
0	Hasn't started yet. Wait until January 2021. Then it really goes down hill
0/0	Hate me for this but we can't stop globalisation, isolation is not the way to go.
1/1	Have a Great EX-EU free Day
0/0	Have a friend who has worked in the Foreign Office for years and her reaction to how difficult trade deals were going to get should we leave were alarming. People don’t seem to have woken up to the skill drain that has left our shores since the vote took place. Over the past 40 years our negotiators have worked within the remits of the EU pact, most left after the vote as other countries headhunted them - many being EU nationals. Plus they were less than keen to lose the benefit of open travel. That, like the staff shortage in the NHS, means those who are expert in World Trade are few and difficult to find. Judging by the incredibly complex mess our politicians have made has only alienated those who the country needs to cast a better considered vote in a second referendum. Strange how discontent once fueled public action - but now mostly apathy.
1/0	Have faith in God and He will make Brexit a success for the UK that's a clear message Britain should take a closer look
1/1/1/1	Have faith in God and He will make Brexit a success for the UK that's a clear message Britain should take a closer look :=).
0/0	Have faith, there's time, We can still turn this around!
0/0	Have not been on here for a while, but it is no surprise the usual Brexit extremists and anarchists still try to spread their anti EU rubbish. Then also those still completely ignorant of what a calamity they voted for, duped into voting leave by a clown who we now incredibly have as PM. The lunatics really are running asylum.
1/1	Have said all along! No deal! Then, watch the EU come back to the table for a deal. Walk away WTO
0/0	Have we hit the bottom yet?
1/0/1	Have you considered the fact that it might not he a shitshow? What if it isn't as bad as you predict or dare I say, it turns out that living standards DO improve in the next 5 years? Will you be willing to accept you were wrong?
1/-1	Have you distanced yourself from all the racist remoaners? Because if you did you’d be a very lonely badger.
1/0	Having a stricter immigration policy will only disadvantage those who choose to take advantage of Britain in favour of those who will be of the greatest benefit.
0/1	Having common employment laws across 28 member states stops UK workers rights be played off against others #BBCDebate #StrongerIn
1/-1/0	He also promised the DUP there would be no border down the Irish sea right up until he caved in to the EU's demands.
1/0	He can brutally slap whoever he wants, fact is we are in very weak position compared to the EU and any feeble slaps we can deal are unlikely to be felt.
1/1	He does not understand why Britain is strong enough. We need no EU industry or Euros. The British people have paid so much money to build up atomic bombs, atomic subs, and good British atomic country. Some Brits have nothing to eat and must even starve because of our wonderful atomic British world we have built up and paid for. The EU industry and money and the Russian oligarchs have to go - leave our country - we need no EU or Russian oligarchs!! They destroy our Britain!
0	He is going to make the UK poorer GDP growth 1,1 % When reality hits his failure will be a huge and this pipe dream about reigniting the British Empire fake dream
0/0	He is not my Prime Minister. He is a charlatan.
0/0	He replied that he had voted Leave at the Brexit referendum because he wants what’s best for England. For England. He voted Leave because of ENGLAND. Then ask me why I support Scottish independence.
0/-1	He said a lot without saying anything...
0/1	He says he will strengthen the country - that's the idea so him the chance to try.
1/1	He should be concerned as pro-EU-religious zealots have handed the men of violence a perfect excuse not to follow the demorcratic process by constantly demonising those that voted leave and doing their best to ignore that vote. So democracy doesn’t work; why bother?
0/0	He should be given a medal for standing and telling the truth, unpleasant though it may be to those dumb enough to be following a "Brexit" route. VOTE IN IN IN !!!!
1	He was also very covertly #probrexit while being overwhelmingly polite. It's good to get out of London bubble sometimes
1/-1	He went to jail to free his country from dictators, was a Parliamentarian during its transition
0/0	Heart goes out to workers & families at Philips facing redundancy. Parliament failed you; I won’t give up on you.

1/-1	Here here Nigel!!
0/0	Here is my 2020 to 2040 predictions; 1) Scotland will separate, regardless of what London wants. 2- Ireland will recover and do very well with EU trade. 3) Trump will lose and the new Admin will take a softer approach but the result is the same- parasitical capitalism enters the UK. The pound thinks its better off but will decrease in value. Leavers will enjoy learning how to clean their old and dying ,instead of the cheap labor,they deem to spit on.Also they will enjoy cleaning, washing dishes , picking fruit all day long and so on. After 10 yrs of this shitt - they will give up and plead to rejoin the EU -who will reject their pleas!
1/1/0	Here is the thing: the Europeans have done NOTHING to stabalise the eurozone, they've made things worse by passing the 2016 bail-in rules.
0/0	Here is what every country in the world is learning about brexit brittain. A completly self absorbed country unable to find common ground with anyone else or find solutions for common problems.

1/1	Here’s a thought, why don’t all the remainers stop whining, and go live the EU paradise they adore and stop being so nasty and petty to the good democratic folk of the UK
0/1	Here’s an idea, how about we stay in and fully commit to joining the eurozone, but every member has to be treated the same and put the same amount of money in, also has to offer the same standard of living in each country; at your tax payers expense of course.
0/0	Here’s an idea, why doesn’t the UK try to shape Europe rather than trying to hide away from it?
1/1	Hey Britain, the USA is here, ready and want to do business with our cousins. Everything you've relied on the EU for we have in abundance and we can do it better. Give US a chance.
1/0	Hey britboy, just because an EU commissioner says something does not mean we should immediately switch to no deal. it’s worth the effort continuing to have some dialogue first.
1/1	Hey the people already voted actually.
1/1	Hey uk deserve the right to rule themselves.
0/0	Hey! I have only one question. We are many here in Sweden who buy electronics, clothes, spare parts plus many many more things via the internet from the UK. Sweden plus many other European countries have cars, tractors, machines, kitchenware etc. made in England. Many of those internet companies may lose a lot of money. We outside of the UK do not find British manufactured items anymore at an exemplary price. We have built up a security to buy goods from the UK that we can not find outside of the UK. Do people in the UK know how many people have a business relationship with Europe over the internet?
0/0	Hey, people. I am British and do NOT want to leave the EU. I am ashamed at some of the eurosceptic outpourings from politicians. I am proud to be European and thin it as astonishing achievement that we have al held together in the last 70 years. We’re not all bad !!!
1/1	Hey, you must be a new kid around here, don’t you know thinking outside the Reddit hive isn’t cool? The mainstream media has told me that the EU are the good guys! No really, how does a “trading bloc” turn into a “United States of Europe” with a military and no fucker is concerned. Full of tricks these folks.
0/1	Hi, I am another German. I am very pro European integration. I would like something better than the EU but that's what we have to work with. On one side I would like it, if the UK would be with us in this effort. For the talent and strength the UK could bring to the table, i am sad to see them leave. On the other hand, experience has shown that the UK actively hinderes further integration. The whole process of Brexit has shown, that even most remainers are only in it for their own benefits. That's why I am happy this unfortunate relationship is ending, and the rest of the EU can face the future without worrying about the family diva all the time. And as final note: I as a rational person, believe in science. Part of that is experiments. If Brexiteers are right and I as a Pro-EU-Federalist am wrong. I want to see it. For that reason i am happy about Brexit. As it gives all sides the real world answer to what is better. With that in mind I am even prepared for the breakup of the EU in case of a Brexit success.
1/0	Hi, I'm Andy, pleased to meet you.I enjoy freedom of movement through EU.
1/1	Hi, actually from the Uk, and voted to leave the EU.
0/0	Hi, it is right that the UK leaves the EU while some of the UK politicians are unscrupulous enough to fool their own people with services like Cambridge Analytica. Hopefully the UK will not cut all kinds of standards (health, work, environment) to gain competitive advantage over the EU. That would only negatively affect the regular people. From the EU anthem: “Indeed, who even just has one soul to call his own in this world! And who never managed it should slink weeping from this union!” When the Cummings and Farages have no saying anymore, hopefully the UK will return. I strongly believe that is will be beneficial for the UK and the EU not just regarding trade. Greetings from Germany!
0/0	Hilarious and beautiful trolling by the EU. Pay up, UK, and FO.
1/-1/0	Hilarious how liberals didn’t want to listen to the vote that the people casted, typical socialists who don’t accept votes that don’t go their way
0/0	Hilarious how many dumbski leavers are going to be crying over time when they realise they've been duped by a bunch of Tory conmen who are only in it for themselves and the top 1% wealthy. You are telling me you can look at the above catalogue of Tory MPs and say that you trust these oligarchical pawns with your life? Unbelievable.
0/0	Hilarious stuff... and now all the leave voters are blaming politicians for this mess. This is the result of giving democracy to a bunch a people who have absolutely no clue about what they’re voting for. What a mess.
0/0	Hilarious. Europe say it will take years if we leave as do the yanks, but still brexiters continue to believe the uk will be fine. Tell me exactly who are we going to trade with??
0/0	Hilarious. Nigel should go to university and learn some rational thinking to replace the crap and lies presented here. It would appear that he has been milking Europe for years through your MEP salary and so called extra MEP perks. Both of his wives were non British. What a hypocrite. Cheers!
0/0	Hindsight from 2019 :D I have never seen a bigger shitfest than Brexit and I have seen 2 girls one cup :).
1/1	Hip hip hooray for Britain!!
0/0	His grasp of the facts is beyond doubt however. Not that mastery of the English language tends to be much of a Brexiteer trait anyhow, having said that.
1/1	Historically, this country has always done well by avoiding foreign entanglements. Brexit can only be for the good. Also historically, our foreign policy was based on "balance of power" in Europe. We ensured no-one got too big. One has to wonder if our government-in-residence (the civil service) hasn't been still following this policy: our leaving now, with the EU at its weakest, will ensure that member countries will be at each others' throats over the budget shortfall. The suggestion being true or not is irrelevant: this is a mortal blow for the EU - Nemesis in action - and even if the EU survives, it won't prosper. Without the UK, it simply doesn't generate enough to keep itself afloat: the Germans, rigorous as they are, can't do it all alone.
0/0	History exams in 2050: "Whose fault was Brexit?
1/1	History remembers a time when the UK was a nation of explorers. Now it seems we're consumers of the crumbs from EU's table. #brexit #leave
0/0	History tells us that new eras generally follow disasters . The disaster hasn't happened yet
0/0	History will find the old men in the Conservative Party who have planned and plotted this day with an obsession bordering on delusion responsible for a very large step down in the history of our nation. Our economic health, our civic life, the life chances of young people and our status on the world scene will be diminished. A shameful episode.
0/0	History will judge it harshly
0/0	History will not be kind to your legacy. The rest of the world already sees you - and now the UK - as a pitiable joke.
0/0	History will record Cameron's submission of Brexit to the popular vote as the dumbest decision by any British PM since Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler by handing over Czechoslovakia.
1/1/1	History will show Brexit was best thing we could ever have done. Nationalism is good, it works. Nationalism is on the rise across all of Europe. France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands... The people of Europe never asked for a United States of Europe. Overwhelmingly they don't want it, nor will they let it happen either. Britain was the first to leave the EU. But we won't be the last ;)
1/1	History won't remember this evening as the moment the UK regained its independence. It will be the moment when the self-righteous establishments dream of an authoritarian EU died.

0/0	Hmm what a childish nationalist mess this country is in. Fuck me the U.K. is just turning into one big steaming pile of a nationalist shithole before our very eyes.
1/0	Hmm, isn't self-interest exactly what Brexit is about?
0/0	Hmmm, given that Brexit is going to be a disaster whatever happens, No Deal is beginning to sound quite attractive if it makes the bastard Tories pay for their stupidity. Make them unelectable until the late 2030s.

1/1	Hogwash. The UK is one of the USA largest exporters, and only 3 or 4 of the other EU countries are comparible. Scaremongering and lies. I'm not falling for it. That's why I'm voting OUT.

0/0	Honest question from a remainer here. How do you imagine your life improving after Brexit takes place? Genuinely asking what effect you think it will have on your day to day life.
0/0	Honestly even though I don’t the UK being made fun of, I can see why people would. This situation is pretty wack.
0/0/0	Honestly it seems like the Russians got exactly what they wanted. The UK has spent years only focusing on this one stupid issue. And it literally might end the UK entirely with Scotland and Wales and NI wanting to stay in the EU. To me I just think at some point, the Prime Minister should just say “fuck it” and throw the whole idea out. Call it quits and just stay in the EU.
1/1	Honestly this is the EU's fault for treating the UK like second-class citizens when they were clearly one of the most wealthy countries in the agreement, the EU relied on the UK significantly, yet Brussels made all of the decisions about policy in the UK.
0/0	Honestly, I really don't think brexit will solve any of the problems the UK faces. We will still have a useless government, non EU immigration policy will remain the same, the forgotten corners of the UK will remain ignored by the UK
1/1	Honestly, I thought these people were team British. All these remainers should stop talking the country down!
0/0	Honestly, how there ever was a referendum without clear exit plan is utterly befuddling
0/1/-1/1	Honestly, this already took so long and now it’s gonna take at least another year for a trade deal? What a major waste of time.

Someone posted about Remainer distortions of Norway's relationship with the EU.

0/0	How did it happen that UK decided to leave EU without any plan? It takes years of preparations law adjustments even changes in construction to join the Union. Why anyone thought it would be easy to just leave it? Where is the plan B or C? I don't think the EU is flawless but if you want to leave you have to be fully prepared for all outcomes and have full support of the nation. There are many countries that 'want' (lately have new and/or more conservative parties more popular) to leave but after the brexit mess I don't think they will do it

One thing Britain must do, is to re-gain her legacy and stop selling off our assets or privatisation of major/manufacturing industries. We must safeguard and regenerate our British values and heritage.

0/-1	However I strongly believe that it needs reform.
1/1	However if Britain is leaving the EU it is also not able to participate in the process of creating a more democratic EU. The EU is not perfect and needs to be adapted to be more efficient and democratic. However by abandoning it, you leave the decision to the other countries and watch from the outside.
0/-1	However it pans out with the Corona Virus (global pandemic or infection peters out)
1/-1	However this is still a free country and we are free to reject it, while abiding by the law
0/0	However, we don't get services access to the EU unless they say so.
0/0	Huge mistake IMO. Also, the fact that all it took was a simple majority to make such a drastic decision like that was another mistake on the UK government's part. A vote like that should require a 3/5ths majority imo.

0/0	I 100% am voting to stay. All the expects from multiple fields think this is the right opinion, with intelligent qualified people saying leave being the exception rather than the norm. Leaving will make travelling (something I love) more difficult/expensive and could have major negative economic effects for years to come. I really hope the country makes the right choice when we vote and lots of people do actually vote. There is such a terrible attitude amongst people (particularly young people) that it's not worth voting, which is really harmful.

1/1	I SUPPORT YOU LOVING YOUR COUNTRY! I can only hope for a better path for the States - be nice to not send all my money to china and mexico manufacturing, and taking care of 10 million plus illegals from all countries with my tax dollars. I want more in my paycheck - but I'm a hater to support a border for my country - bringing back the jobs. The nuts are in the jar - but the more we keep out the better - and that begins at our borders and airports. Britain is now again an island, I think Churchill would like that, you set forward a tsunami of change in the world. A royal flushing, and the world needed that - and the people spoke - as they will in November in America - the silent majority want change too.
1/1	I Support Brexit and still do.

1/-1	I absolutely adore him. There’s a really optimistic buzz in The City that has been absent for over ten years.
0/0	I absolutely agree with this piece; it articulates pretty much everything that motivated me to vote Remain and my current fears for our country. The lack of leadership both nationally and on the wider international stage is very worrying and I don't see anyone with the skills or vision to tackle the serious problems we face. Here in the Disunited Kingdom, we are lurching to the right and, as the piece says, hard-won freedoms are under threat. It's very depressing.
0/0	I absolutely despite Brexit; many of the people who voted to leave did so out of xenophobia, and the whole negotiation process has been a mess. Brexit has made me feel ashamed of my country.
0/0	I actually agree with you, which is why I voted remain. I don't think protectionism (be it in labour or markets) has any real positives for society as a whole.
1/1	I actually feel a touch sorry for the eu commission. They see their influence drifting away. They try to have greater influence by making even more stupid demands, but it's too late. We've gone. Bad luck guys.
1/-1	I actually think that if people voted remain and they've still not got over it as of 31/01/2020, then they should probably be having a long hard think as to whether the UK is the country for them to stay in.
1/0	I actually think that it would be quite bad for the UK to leave the EU. Its not a perfect marriage, but the full consequences and complications of that have not been studied properly and I don't think most people are really quite aware of how much uncertainty and volatility it will add to an already shaky situation.
1/1	I advise British people stop panic and realize that life is still continue even without EU . Look at USA , Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea these countries is not in EU and they have a great economy . And finally i wish UK put their trust in God and Savior Jesus Christ.
1/1	I advocate leaving the EU, however my fear is simple. If the remain camp win this country will be nothing but a second class member of the EU super state, no longer self governing but controlled entirely from Brussels, Strasburg but mainly Berlin. The UK will have no say in the way the EU is run or funded, it will be the laughing stock of Europe. This country must I hope Vote to leave on the 23rd June.
0/0	I agree BillC. Use your head, vote Remain.
0/0	I agree and still my main reason for supporting remain is that they have enhanced our environmental and employment practices. Many Brexiters actively campaigned on removing these regulations and I don't trust those who brush those points aside.
1/1	I agree the Commonwealth of Nations will save the UK's economy
0/0	I agree there are plenty of things wrong with the EU, but most of them have little effect on our daily lives
1	I agree with Boris, there's no need to be too close to the EU. We should have never be so close with them in the first place. Good that we're out.
0/0/0	I agree with Macron, this is a lose lose, but a huge ammount is going to depend on whether the current both hard and yet utterly unclear line that Johnson is taking is the act or the reality of his actual ambitions...
1/1	I agree with Mr Davis ,but if the Government truely repects the will of the 17.4 million they can follow Mr Moggs advice and close parliment which will put an end too the remoaners dirty tricks
0/0	I agree with the majority here. It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand. What still baffles me the most to this day is why Teresa May triggered article 50 when she did. Any kind of leverage was lost in that moment because she set the timer for the self-destruction mechanism.
1/1	I agree with the video, but even if Brexit was to make me poorer, personally I still would have voted to leave.
1/1	I agree with this and its one of the core reasons I want out. In my opinion the issue with immigration isn't the numbers, its the type of people. We should apply the same standards to european migrants that we do to non eu migrants and allow people in who prove they will give back. Its a disgrace we turn away hard working skilled workers from outside the EU while allowing any european in. Just look at the comments from people like George Osborne to see how out of touch the remain campaigners are with immigration. His solution to curbing immigration is to tighten restrictions on non eu immigration- he wants to turn away more skilled immigrants to allow more potentially non skilled immigration. Who benefits from this because it isn't fairer for immigrants and it isn't better for the UK. On an unrelated point, I think we should leave because the EU is unreformable (at least without a sudden direction change). Cameron gave it his best shot to get reforms and what they offered was a joke. "Change or we'll leave" is the strongest position we can negotiate from inside the EU and Cameron got nothing. All the remainers saying we'll reform the EU from inside fail to explain how we are going to trigger this change. What leverage are we suddenly going to get that will make the eu rethink its position? All staying in will do is tell the EU that the british people are happy and it will look like a green light to carry on. Whether we wish to leave for good or simply negotiate a new EU like relationship with Europe we have a better chance doing it from a position of power outside of the EU. Staying in is not a vote to keep things the same and its not a risk free vote. The eu has changed drastically since the creation of the common market and its only going in one direction, it is taking sovereignty and binding countries together. If we stay in the eu who knows what state it will be in in 5, 10 or 15 years time. If we vote stay then decide to leave in 10 years all the economic concerns could be a lot worse, at this point we really should decide whether we are in it to the end or we should get out now. There is no shame in leaving, abandoning a sinking ship isn't quitting, its common sense.
0/1	I agree, Brexit would have been better executed under Farage
0/0	I agree, the UK politicians have been hugely damaging the UK. Luckily, being in the EU, only few noticed. As soon as the UK is out, all kind of problems that so far have been hidden will explode to everyone’s face…
1/1	I agree, there is still plenty to do but we at last heading in the direction the majority wanted..
1/1	I agree, we voted leave, SO, leave. The EU will come running when they realise what they stand to lose. We can buy direct from countries around the world. Leave the EU to swim in it’s own problems and leave us alone

1/1	I also voted in 1975 to remain in a 'Common Market' not in the European Union which didn't exist at the time. We were conned by Heath and the establishment and a terrible wrong has been righted.
0/0	I always find it cynical of brexiteers who say they only wanted to be part of a common market. They are effectively saying they don't share the ideals of the EU, which was all about peace. They have an exploitative attitude but can't see the ugliness of it.
0/0/0	I always thought that adults know what they are doing. Now as im growing older i notice everyone is actualy just clueless
1/1	I am 100% behind you Boris. Keep going as our PM!
1/1	I am 100% for Brexit and I’m American
0/0/0	I am 17 years old, I am a student and currently study politics. Last night a decision was made which will have a direct impact on my future. The decision to leave the EU was made without my voice being heard. I couldn’t vote in what is probably the most important political decision the British people have made, an irreversible decision. I have followed these campaigns, I am capable of making an informed and rational choice – the fact that I wasn’t able to, that many other informed and passionate 16/17-year-olds were not able to, seems to me incredibly undemocratic. My future is completely changed; I will not have the benefits my parents and their generation have had, such as freedom of movement between all EU countries. Mostly I am outraged that this decision, which reflects on the British people, has been made without my consent. The future already looks less bright for us and it is a future I did not have a say in shaping.
1/1/1	I am 23 and I support Brexit
1/1	I am American & I support Brexit, but I hate all Brexit supporters except myself for being antiCommunist antiMarxist nationalist hypocrites who only want to replace one form of collectivist oppression with another: nationalism (and christianity).
0/0	I am British and I'm relocating to a European Union country before I'm caught up in this shambles.
0/1	I am British and do NOT want to leave the EU. I am ashamed at some of the eurosceptic outpourings from politicians. I am proud to be European and thin it as astonishing achievement that we have al held together in the last 70 years.
1/1	I am British and proud of it. The referendum was the first opportunity in my lifetime to have my say
1/1	I am English first, British second, And European as a distant third
1/0	I am European by culture, descent and sentiment. I speak (rustily) several European languages. I have served in or with German, French and Norwegan Armed Forces. I love and know Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Norway. I loathe the unaccountable bureaucracy of the EU. I do not support its continued existence. I am a democrat.
0/0	I am European. Since 1993, as EU members, Britons have been able to live and work anywhere within the member states. This allowed me to live and work both in France and Italy and identify as European. Will future generations do and feel the same?
0/1/1	I am French but I support the brexit because I understand perfectly well that the English do not want to see their culture fall apart
0/0	I am LibDem voter who wants to #StopBrexit
1/1	I am SO HAPPY that we are leaving. Against all odds we won our Democratic Vote. Next sort out the Civil Service to abide by Democratic Votes they tried everything to get us to remain. Don’t ever underestimate the British. THANK YOU NIGEL FARAGE I respect you and will never forget you. Get your knighthood and fight for our rights in The Lords we will need you there as you aren’t an MP which you should be
1/1	I am SO PROUD and SO HAPPY for the British people. They have gone through dark times before, but they always fight their way back.
0	I am STILL and ALWAYS WLL BE - European
1	I am a 20 year old who couldn't vote since I was a few months off. I would have voted leave and probably would still do that
0/0	I am a 24-year-old British-Asian woman from London. I voted remain. I am so deeply saddened by the results I watched come in through the night. It seems I’ve been experiencing the run-up to the election in some sort of bubble on my Facebook page, where it is filled by the people who have similar political leanings. This is what makes it even more shocking. In the past three weeks I have experienced harassment (physical and verbal) on public transport. Two out of the three have included racial slurs. It is hard to disassociate that from the rhetoric of the leave campaign, which seems to have given a voice to “moderate” racists and xenophobes. It can’t be a coincidence that several of my friends have experienced a similar thing. I have lived in this country all my life and for the first time feel very ashamed to be British. I am angry that the older generation have selfishly voted for a future that I will have to live with. Young people did not vote for this. I am angry that I have to wake up to Nigel Farage’s smug face claiming that the NHS figures that have been touted were a lie. I am angry that my European friends, as well as my non-white British friends and family members have woken up to a less safe, more divided country.
0/-1	I am a European and a rejoiner. Fuck those who used lies, manipulation, lawbreaking, fearmongering and bigotry to rob us of our rights! Fuck those who tell us now is the time for unity in acceptance of their pathetic worldview after they've spread division for years! Fuck Brexit!
1/1/1	I am a passionate, pragmatic, and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the E.U.
1/1	I am a professional myself with board positions in several international companies. I also voted leave.
1/1	I am a socialist and believe in democracy, and my main sticking point was the secret TTIP discussions and I was fearful for our NHS. I am an EU national as well as a British citizen, and I also didn’t like the lies from the remain camp telling us that our workers’ rights exist only because of the EU. Trade unions fought for our rights as they have always done. We need to hold our politicians accountable and vote them out if necessary. We can now choose how we spend our own nation’s money and not be given our pocket money like children. We can decide who we trade with. We shall decide the terms of that trade by negotiation. We shall set our own agenda. We shall be able to keep our public services and not be forced to privatise them, and if we choose we can re-nationalise our industries which would not be allowed in the EU. I didn’t like the way remain were continuously trying to imply that anyone who didn’t agree with them must fit the media’s narrative that a leave voter is a rightwing bigot. I believe in every country determining its own fate and I have always supported nations claiming independence for its own people. Why are we considered bigots or racists for wanting to make our own decisions for our own country? Whatever the long-term outcome for our country, I believe in freedom and self-determination. I hope we can get over the divisions and work together to find our identity once again. What kind of a nation we want to become will be decided by us, and we shall succeed or fail by our own efforts as a nation together. I have been truly shocked and saddened by the vitriol spewing from members of the remain camp, especially the younger voters who have even suggested that the right to vote should be withdrawn from older people who disagree with them. What great advocates for democracy!
1/1	I am a supporter of democracy so would be hypocritical if I didn't support Brexit.
0	I am actually scared about the referendum result. Too many people will vote out purely based on immigration and it's quite sad. #VoteRemain
1	I am afraid it is not that simple.  For many Remainers, it is axiomatic that Brexit will be a disaster.  They are not 80% sure it will be a disaster, or 90% sure, but 100% sure.  Such Remainers will be talking Britain down for years into the future.  Now they may be right - personally, I am 80% sure Britain will be better off with Brexit, on a five-year time frame.  What I believe will happen is that the EU will start crashing in the next 1 to 10 years.  The next recession might do it, or it might be the changing dynamic, now that France and Germany are lead nations.  I suspect that the French now recognize that expansion eastwards was a mistake - I would say probably a fatal mistake - but holding up Albania and Northern Macedonia's entry is too little too late.  But it is only when Europe crashes that Remainers might accept that the UK got it right - and even then, perfidious Albion is likely to be blamed for undermining the wonderful experiment.
0/0	I am afraid that a lot of Brexiters KNEW they were lied to but they did not care because most were blinded by xenophobia. They are what is known as SINGLE ISSUE voted where any damage is acceptable as long as their xenophobia is addressed.
0/0	I am against brexit, if things goes south we can always move to another EU country.?
0/0	I am against the British exit.If Britain exits the EU,the Federalists will have more power as Britain is the biggest and most powerful nation opposing Federalism in the EU.
0/0	I am against. I travel a lot and freedom of movement is far too important to me to scrap. I'm expecting to do some work in Frankfurt, Warsaw and Milan over the next year and I'd much rather do it without all the red tape. It's one of the best things about the EU but not enough Brits take advantage of it. I think if we learned foreign languages from primary school upwards, more people would be thrilled about heading to Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc. for work.
1/1	I am an ardent leaver who is so glad Brexit is done, but I am also an ardent believer in the union and cannot contemplate it being broken up by xenophobic claptrap. I am a proud yorkshireman but England did,nt make us great by ourselves, we became this great nation because we are a union, we will continue to be a great nation as we move out into the world again because we are a union.
1/1/1	I am an east African living in Sweden and endorse Brexit for many reasons.
1/1	I am an unabashed Anglophile and I see this as a great day for all of you. Europe was holding you back.
1/1/1	I am and always will be an English man and a citizen of Great Britain and jolly proud of it. I am not a European they are a different race than me.
0/0	I am ashamed of the 'insularness' of my fellow Brits. The future for mankind is for nations to draw closer together in harmony NOT to split apart.
0/0	I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out.
0/0	I am astounded by the stupidity of the British politicians. About to drive their country off a cliff but people still trust them because JRM has a posh accent?
1/1	I am attached to a strict approach to Brexit: I respect the British vote, but the worst thing would be a sort of weak E.U. vis-a-vis the British.
1/1	I am beginning to to think that people do not think like me or you? Or simply do not care? Maybe we are the crazy ones for wanting a safer better country.
1/1	I am clearly raising a few pints of Irish and English beer tonight!!! Congratulations Great Britain . Now you can work on becoming “great again “ !!!!! Cheers !!!!
0/0	I am completely lost by the British style of negotiations. At first I suspected that the lousy results were due to the intellectual low qualities of the British bunch of idiots d' village marshalling the Brexit but maybe its in line with the glorious history of British diplomacy which outcomes appears only on the very last day of the negotiations.
0/0	I am deeply disappointed because Politico published this article. And this is not due to the fact I am pro-EU. This is because the this article is highly biased and reckless.
0/0	I am devastated that we are leaving the EU shame on all of you that voted leave
0/0	I am disgusted at how the British MEP’s behaved, the other countries expressed sorrow but also how much the British have done for the Europe and then sang ol Lang syne, while our MEP’s made it all about them and the British, flaunting laws and basically saying good riddance... they should have shown respect not nationalist guff. A very sad day.
1/1/1	I am english, you are European.. We are not the same
0/0	I am fed up with Brexiteers in denial about the political chaos and economic damage that they inflicted on the UK, with the help of Catastrophe Cameron. The politicians are laughing at you. 37.5% of the electorate voted to make us all poorer. That's what you wanted and that's what they'll give you. They don't care, it won't affect them. They’ll still have their jobs long after you have lost yours.
0/-1	I am firmly for staying in but such interference is unacceptable.
1/1	I am from Austria, I am happy about brexit.
1/1	I am from Dublin Ireland and I think we should leave the EU well done Uk

0/0	I am from wales and i think it was a terrible idea to leave the EU
1/1	I am glad, Europe is a great idea on paper but not working.
0/0	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion
0/0	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion.. Someone please dissuade me of these thoughts.
1/1	I am happy for you, you have finally managed to drop the chains of the EU. I only wish you the best for the future. Down with the EU dictatorship.
1/1	I am having my own bank holiday on 23rd of June. !
1/1	I am having optimistic beliefs that we will leave on the 31st.
0/0	I am impressed how the EU has remained united and how it has negoiated. There two ways forward either we take the best route which is to stop Brexit or she drops her stupid red lines. At the moment she is trying for something that will not work. We need strong leaders who put the country first and provide us a way out of this disaster. The WTO approach makes no sense at all
1/1	I am in the U.S. and the media here is saying that if there is a hard Brexit, there will be food shortages, and the housing market will crash. I'm not sure why they are pushing this false narrative.
0	I am incredibly sorry to see the UK leave. I think it is a huge, idiotic mistake that will benefit no one.
0/-1	I am no longer willing to act against my own interests in order to help those who are so dead set on acting against their's. Fuck 'em.
1/1	I am not a radical simply because I support my nation- I am not a bigot because I believe in British jobs for British workers- I am not a racist just because I think British people should be put first- I am not intolerant just because I want our borders closed to protect our culture and identity- I should not be classified as extream because I want extremists deported- & most important of all I should not have to explain myself in my own country.
0/0	I am not being defeatist. I know referenda are very dangerous ways of deciding the fate of a nation - see what happened on 23 June 2016. Can you guarantee Remain will win this time?  As a staunch remainer, I hope it will - but I am not at all sure.
1/1	I am not british but european....get out of EU !! We support you and will probably follow soon!!
1/1	I am now absolutely certain that the UK must leave as soon as possible.
0/0	I am now absolutely terrified that my family is going to split up. My wife is Danish and she may be forced to leave us, perhaps taking our 1 year old son away :(
1/1	I am old enough to remember joining the EU...we joined.. we didn't "crash in" so why are we "crashing out" we are leaving. Language is so emotive ...
1/1/1	I am old enough to remember the UK BEFORE we joined the EU. I for one couldn't be happier to be out of it! Now we can get back to some common sense, making our own laws once again, and looking after our own affairs, instead of being dictated to, and having our wealth squandered on European projects!
1/0	I am packing my things
1/0	I am pretty sure other countries will do the same to be able to get some good trade deals with the US..
1/1	I am proud of Britain. We Americans should Leave the UN and end all treaties with Mexico and other nations that are not in our best interests. We should do more trade directly with Great Britain and any other nations that leave these shitty one world government movements.
0/0	I am ready to campaign with all my heart and soul to keep Britain inside a reformed European Union
0/0/1	I am really looking forward for no deal brexit showdown ... it's going to be spectacular. In case of a no deal brexit, I'd say less then 30 days for UK coming back to EU. More popcorn pls.
0/0	I am sick and tired of Brexit. It's a bad idea that hasn't gotten any better with the passage of time and vast amounts of resource. End it with membership of the single market and customs union please... and a P45 for N Fartage.
1/1	I am sick and tired of the British always carping and whining about Europe. You want to leave? Then leave!!
1/1	I am sick of being told by politicians and newscasters alike that when I voted "leave" that I was mislead. I voted "leave" and with it, all its consequences, good and bad. REMOANERS get over it and stop trying to mislead the electorate.
0/0	I am smelling a huge recession in #UK after yesterday’s #Brexit plan.
1/1	I am so angry at the whinging politicians who are in total denial as to the result of the Referendum. They were given a clear instruction by the people : LEAVE THE EU.
1/1	I am so glad I am not a remainer. Many seem desperate for their country and fellow citizens to suffer so that they can be proved right. What a mean-spirited, narrow-minded outlook on life. And what if the UK does well? Will they simply become ever more embittered? Move on for God's sake, if only for the sake of your own mental health.
0/0/1	I am so glad remain will win. I might even invite a family of migrants over to celebrate. Bye bye Boris the loser.
1/1	I am so glad we have left the EU.....I bloody cried when I heard the results early in the morning.
1/1	I am so happy we are leaving - Brexit has exposed the true colours of the EU bullies and how bad the Labour Party has become
1/1	I am so happy we left
1/1	I am so tired of the 2/3 argument. A choice not to vote is acquiescence to the final decision. Those under 18 have their rights to decide ceded to adults who have their interests at heart. We voted legally and lawfully. It came out Leave. Should it have come out Remain, I would have accepted it, voted to an MEP who would hopefully work to reform the EU and gone forward. I expected the same. Clearly not. The fact we have bungled the current process doesn't negate a decision made and the need to carry through with it. But hey, I'll keep your quote handy if we have a second Referendum and it comes out Remain. So we can go on to a 3rd, 4th and on and on until the EU builds a wall and asks us to leave or move to Canda.
1/1	I am still a Leaver
0/0	I am still hoping to remain...
0/0	I am sure in a 1000 years, when the look back at the brexit mess, they won’t say ”this was their finest hour”...
1/1	I am sure the EU is just trying to scare----they don't scare me. We were fine before we went into the EU years ago, we would be fine whatever we did.......we have everything going for us
1/1	I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
0/0	I am truly sick to death of hearing Theresa May say “ the British people voted to leave” ! It’s a lie! Only 37% of the British people voted to leave . This is what she should be saying every time, she should not be allowed to say it as if it was all of us . Really makes me angry!
1/1	I am very happy for the UK and hope soon EUXIT! We don't need the EU for import or export... and everything is coming from China, haha We don't want mass migration... and more then 60% where against the EU but pushed their EU into our throat... And their wet dream is to set up an army to fight against Russia... They don't like peace, they only like your money, haha
1/1	I am very proud of England for taking a stand, and I support them
0/0	I am voting #remain because I want my Britain back. A creative, generous, tolerant place. #strongerin
1/1/1/1	I am voting Leave. I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it. To say that the only way that we can exist as part of Europe and will only prosper as part of it, seems idiotic to me.
1/1	I am voting leave for independents and more control to the people of England because I really disapprove of bureaucracy organisation I still to this very day accept the view that the Politian's should be in service to the public not the other way around.
0/0	I am voting remain, I have swung back and forth a couple of times but now I am solid in my stance. If we leave Europe there is a chance it will be amazing for our economy, but why take that chance? Sure this country isn't nearly perfect at the moment but it isn't terrible, why put our future up to chance? Stick with what we know works.
0/0	I am worried but when I aired my concerns on facebook I got verbally shot down by an aunt of mine. I was just worried about the future but I had to laugh because it will likely be my generation who will have to deal with the ramifications of it, not hers.
1/1	I am, and always have been, a fervent Brexiteer. My concern however, is the potential impact on the availability of the medication that keeps me alive, and it's not trivial stuff, it's literally life and death. Quite recently I have given as much as ten days notice of my requirements of my medication, and they have not been forthcoming until the very last day.
0/0	I and many other sensible people will have already maneuvered to ensure my EU citizenship is not stripped from me against my will, by taking advantage of the many loopholes available to claim dual nationality. Have your cake and eat it too!
1/1/0	I approve of anything giving the finger to the EU.
0/0	I assume all the Brexiteers who hate being run by unelected bureaucrats will now turn their attention to the House of Lords & fully democratising it. That’s assuming most even know it’s role, history & function. I won’t hold my breath.
0/-1	I assume that the EU will be putting pressure on to Spain to give Catalonia their preferred independence.
0/-1	I avoided the news and watched comedy on the television; although I couldn’t laugh, it reminded me that there is intelligence and good humour in the world.
0/1	I back anything Putin wants to end

1/1	I believe everyone has accepted that the eu is a failed project, with the exception of a few brainwashed remoaner thicko's.
1/0	I believe in democracy so we must accept the result and implement Brexit.
0	I believe one can own a pellet gun or even a shotgun in England....and if one has to use it to protect another creature, one should never giggle about it on social media.
0/0	I believe that the United Kingdom will be more comfortable if we stay in the economic structures of the EU.
0/0	I believe that the difference between a remainer and a leaver is that a remainer knows they lost, a leaver doesn't know yet
1/1	I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit
0/0	I believe that you have been hood winked by a pompous leader who is only interested in profiting the rich but now it's too late for you to change your subordinate minds
0/0	I believe the EU is a great thing
1/1	I believe this country will thrive and prosper in the years to come.
0/0/0	I believe we should stay in purely because there's far too much to risk if we leave. The Leave campaign cannot say anything with any certainty because nobody has ever left the EU. They seem to make out that we would be able to negotiate a utopian deal if we leave, particularly when it comes to immigration and trade. However, I doubt it will be that simple. If, for example, we were to leave and we still wanted to trade within the single market/EU we will still have to contribute to the budget without getting any say. That being said, the reason why I'm voting in has nothing to do with the In campaign. The campaigns for both sides have been shambolic and full of lies and the media have behaved abominably as well.
1/1	I bet I'm not regretting my leave vote...and there has been no post Brexit disaster!
0/0	I bet Ireland will never forgive the evil British. Serves Britian right that we Singaporeans kicked those colonists out of my country.
1/1	I bet once boris gets tough with the EU, the EU will roll over like little puppy dogs.
0/0	I bet that a mere year after Brexit kicks in a lot of Brits wish they were ‘Remanians’ :-)
0/0	I bet the Scots really wish they had their independence now.
0/0	I bet this will be a disaster probably Ireland and Scotland will withdraw from the United Kingdom and Johnson will be begging the eu for a deal putting Britain even more under their thumb than when it was a member
1/1	I blame the Remainers for consistently denigrating the UK economy and creating Project Fear stories . The latest such stories to bite the dust are financial services are relocating in their hundreds to the rest of the EU yet the number of job adverts for the UK is quadruple the number being advertised in the EU and it seems that applications from overseas to enter UK Universities is at its highest level ever contrary to the rubbish being spouted by University Chancellors. Even the F.T. has to admit very grudgingly the UK economy is doing much better than expected and is the EU economy of the big 4 which is actually looking the most positive .

1/1/-1	I can totally see why the majority of Brexit voters would rather not be a part of EU.

0/0	I can't believe how much misinformation is in this comment section... It's really sad but apparently people is against international cooperation and that leads to war.
1/1	I can't believe that there are still people in the UK who think that they are better off being governed by this bunch of crooks in Brussels, with no hope of a reprieve.
0/0	I can't believe this is true 3 years on, but as someone who used to work with the EU, I find myself in tears about Brexit on a regular basis.

0/0	I can't help but feel that this could lead to a nasty turn of Events... Knowing that Britain might've played their cards wrong, I'd say that this poker game's won by the decision they've made as their money plummets down the drain... I have a slight gut feeling that this could result in a Britain version of the Great Depression. I'm American, but that doesn't mean I have extreme worry for other citizens that I could be friends with in another country! Prayers n' Hopes for the people out in Britain.

0/1	I can't wait until these insufferable Brits are gone, kick them out, no deal, no access, no help. Stop begging and whining, just get on out the door, you're not welcome here.
0/-1/0	I can't, the amount of ignorance demonstrated by the brits is unbearable.
0/0	I cannot believe we are subject to these bunch of clowns who really have no idea what Brexit will do to all of us.
0/0	I cannot help but be angry at the heartlessness of our country. The older generation have put thousands of people's jobs and homes on the line. My mum might be kicked out of Britain because she comes from France. My cousin is half Thai. I have no idea what will happen in the future, and to be honest, I'm scared. I am 13 tears old.
1/1	I cannot tell you how happy I am that we are leaving. It was the rise of UKIP that caused David Cameron to call the referendum.
1/1	I cannot wait till we leave the EU , we just want out country back....Leave means leave !
1/1	I cant wait until the 29th march 2019. Moment of truth for our democracy.
1/1	I cant't believe I live in a country with so many fools. How can leaving the EU be a bad thing? It is a bad thing if you are a self serving mep, banker, rich wanker etc..But if you are just an ordinary Joe like me this vote out is a beautiful thing. Even with all the dark forces against us(95% of media) we still won! Why? Because people are waking up to the tyranny currently rampant in this world. The 1% speak for the 99% and times they are changing. No more. I won't take this shit anymore from a so called elite. No more.
1/1	I can’t believe there are still Remainers on here whinging that they lost and we left the EU? Look boomers, why do you keep looking to history? We are not in the EU and sit in a global market of opportunity. The EU is so passé...
1/0	I can’t think why those behind leave now want remainers to unite, to get on board, make Brexit a success,
1/1	I can’t wait for Hard Brexit. It will be the best ever!
0	I can’t yet vote, and am completely furious with the result. Sixty-four per cent of my town’s votes were counted for leave, and I don’t think I have ever been so disappointed. Almost everything that made Britain great came from being a part of the structure of the EU, and I feel as if casual racism and colloquial xenophobic reactions to immigrants have blinded so many people to the extent in which they would rather rid immigrants than anything else …there were so many benefits of being in the EU that people took for granted, and by the time they notice it’ll already be too late. I feel scared for the future of the economy and the future of our country too. I am not feeling proud to be British, and I think that the majority of my demographic feel similarly.
1/1	I care for our autonomy, vote leave!
0/1	I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited.
0/0	I come from a screwed up country, the USA. But from what I've studied is that Brexit will be a mess. When you are in a union you have more variety and power; no union is perfect, but it is better than nothing. The UK has cut themselves off from a more stable base as I see it.
0/0/0	I come from britain and BREXIT IS THE WORST DESCION
0/0	I completely agree. But it's both sides right? All politics comes down to emotions. "Reason can only be a slave of the passions." Brexit is driven by nationalism, nationalism is driven by ingroup favouritism. It is opposed by desires for equality and liberty. Desires have to be served by reason and reason has no desire. The Tory Brexiteers are the custodians of that Nationalist desire, it is their duty to use reason to further that desire. The average voter that wants that nationalist desire isn't in a position to finalise that expression. This is the role of leadership to handle that desire rationally. And what an absolute mess they have made.
1/1	I congratulate every Englishman on regaining freedom. Only those who have never been FREE can put up with the constant patronizing of unknown bureaucrats. Everyone else doesn't like this at all. Switzerland will now certainly strengthen economic relations with England.👍 nice party, I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes and greetings from Switzerland
1/1	I could not be happier for the people of Great Britain. Freedom always makes me smile.
0/0	I could not believe when the news came up that UK had left EU. I started to think about it, and I think it is a loss for the EU. But it will be a higher loss for UK also. Europe is big, diverse. Uk, cannot only deal with USA and China for trade. We all need each others.
1/1	I couldn't fathom another country making laws that our country has to abide by.
0/-1	I couldn't vote due to my age, and now I can't have the opportunities ALL the older people had gotten when they were younger. I can't freely move about in Europe, and have all the other benefits from the UN.
1/1	I decided to vote leave at the last minute, I had been vote remain for the entire campaign but I couldn’t stand the idea of waking up tomorrow with nothing being done about the EU’s lack of democracy and lack of accountability. I am very restrained and humble right now and I understand that our country will experience a tough period but I’m hopeful for the future and my prospects as a young person.
1/1	I deeply love my country and the things it has achieved throughout history and I don’t want it to become just another number in a nation called ‘The United States of Greater Europe’
1/1	I desire to leave because I want the final authority in this country to be westminster, not brussels. I want the UK to control its own fisheries, not bow and lend them to the rest of the EU. I want the UK to decide who comes into this country, not every other EU member state. Self determination is more important than short term GDP.
1/1	I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain.
1/1	I did it because based on the information i had at the time, it seemed the best thing for our country And yes, i would vote leave again
0/0/0	I did my Master and PhD in Economics in London. I am personally very sad about Brexit.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I did not vote for this, my fellow countrymen are idiots
1/1	I did see a remoaner tweet that accused a member of the crowds decision 2 "black up" showed the level of intelligence of leavers.However, the comment showed how shortsighted "some" remoaners are. It was actually a black gentleman wearing a union flag suit with sunglasses 2 match
0/-1	I didn't believe this would actually happen.
0/0	I didn't support Brexit at all. There seemed to be very little motivation other than anti-immigrant and fear-mongering.
1/1	I didn't vote 'Brexit' or 'No Deal', I voted 'LEAVE'! Listen to these morons desperately trying to save their own jobs by lying to the public. Twisted
1/1/1	I didn't vote as i live in France & felt i did not have the right, But my eyes have been opened since the vote just how corrupt the EU is & what little they think of the British people, It defies belief how they have behaved & i suspect opened many more peoples eyes who like myself were ignorant to what they are really like, We are not going to float Britain away on a large raft to the other side of the world & Europe will be still there after we leave hopefully with no deal now, We are just getting out of a bad deal & plenty of deals could be done in the future as we do buy rather a lot from them, Mr Farage reminds me of the Marcus of Montrose who was hanged & later given a state funeral for his bravery & just actions & maybe one day Mr Farage will receive recognition for his hard work & dedication for the good of the British people.
1/0	I didn't vote for a deal, I voted to LEAVE. T May useless.!
1/1	I didn't vote for cash or race reasons. I voted Brexit because global means complexity and more bureaucracy and less control. Gods save us from idealists.
1/0	I didn't vote in the referendum as I was overseas. But if I had I would have voted to stay in the EU as it didn't seem too bad at the time. But now I would vote in favour of Brexit.
0/0	I didn't want to leave and as a young voter I'm bitter. I'm now genuinely worried about the stability of this country, principally the political fallout with London, Scotland and Northern Ireland been for remain however I don't expect a meteor shower when I wake up. Life goes on I suppose and now we need to work with the hand we been drawn. An era of political and economic uncertainly undoubtedly will now rein over my life for the foreseeable future and will probably impact my ability to enter the job market once I finish my degree. I'm not fond of the EU but I feared the instability of a leave vote more then a decision from the EU which we would've had a veto over.
0/0	I didn't want to leave the EU
0	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it
1/1/1	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it. Sometimes you have to get rid the the old before you can have something new.
1	I didn't watch any ads or any of the campaign material. I made up my own mind, and voted leave
1/0	I didnt think Brexit was a good idea originally but the more I learn about the EU the more I want it
1/1	I didnt think this would happen. The people have Europe have surrendered so much power to government and elite globalist that I didnt think their votes mattered anymore. I am glad I was wrong.
0/-1	I didn’t even get the option to vote in or out because I was 14 at the time
0/0	I didn’t realise no deal would mean we’d lose the ability to spell the word “Government”!!! Brexit is fraught with pitfalls!!!
0/0	I didn’t wanna leave !
1/0	I didn’t want leave the eu
0/0/0	I disagree. There is no 'best of Brexit'.
1/1	I dislike being a constant money pig for the union.
0/0	I do not hv any sympathy to those who talk of any Brexit without knowledge of the logical implications plus the massive short middle term damages to our economy and socially. The Brits MUST be fully aware Not to confuse NATIONAL PRIDE with COMMON SENSE.
0/0	I do not know much about David Cameron but why tf would you let your citizens decide on something so monumental of you yourself say that it's better to stay in???? It's a no brainer!
0/0	I do not see the EU as dictatorship. Quite the opposite. When I moved to Finland I did not have to get anyone's permission or a work permit. But if we leave I might even lose my right of abode and the same for hundreds of thousand of UK pensioners living in Spain ,Portugal, France etc... How is the Health Service going to cope with that influx? And many will need income support because housing costs are so much higher in the UK
0/0	I do not support brexit but i understand their reason and sadly the negotiation will be hard. But i do not like that ppl voted not knowing what EU truly ment. Ans misleading lies from the far far right was also wrong.
1/-1	I do not think Islamic immigrants integrate well into society.
0/0/-1	I do not think that Boris Johnson can call the shots here.
0/0	I do not think that Boris Johnson can call the shots here. Trade represents 40% of UK exports but only 10% of EU exports are to the UK. We will have to take whatever deal the EU is prepared to give us. Which is why Brexit was such a fundamentally flawed idea in the first place.
1/1	I do not trust the EU or its clandestine operations.
1/1	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing
1/1	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing?
1/1	I do not understand why none of the politicians grasp the Immigration issue. OTHER THAN THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BY THE EU. We do not have the infrastructure to cope, this is a simple fact. OUR local school is 33% over subscribed, that AFTER substantially increasing its numbers. A Staff nurse at our local hospital said she is spending THOUSANDS a week obtain interpreters for immigrants who cannot speak English when they attend A and E or appointments. THIS out of the NHS budget. The same hospital is closing a ward due to lack of funding!!! The politicians in this country live in their bubbles NOT the real world. I believe BREXIT will not only shake the EU to the core but bring some normality back to this country. SAFER OUT I firmly believe.
1/1	I do not want to be part of federal Europe. We only ever voted for a trading partnership. Major signed the treaty without a public vote. The EU will not lock UK out of the EU because they can not afford to. UK will simply go back to the original treaty of the EEC.
0/0	I do not wish suffering in the UK despite regarding Brexit as appalling. That is a dark road.
1/1/1	I don't accept this analysis and I was a brexit voter.
0/1	I don't actually have any great admiration for the EU. What made me want to keep them was that I perceived them as keeping the UK right in check, particularly the Conservatives.
0/0	I don't agree with the U.K leaving the EU
0/0	I don't believe in your plan, and will chose to pay my taxes in the EU wherever possible.
0/0	I don't believe that the nationalist nutters and their manipulators on the Tory right could carry a referendum majority any more, but how this plays out in our rotten, cowardly Parliament or under FPTP voting is anyone's guess. We need a People's Vote and we need PR voting.
0	I don't believe this is a very smart move, but time will tell
1/1	I don't blame them for leaving under these circumstances
0/0	I don't blame you. This lovely country has been taken over by racists and morons. There is no future here. If I was younger I would move to Europe too
1/1	I don't care for economists. We need a NO DEAL :) Lets make Britain great again!
1/1/1	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want
1/1	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want
1/1	I don't care what it costs to get us 100% out of the clutches of the failing banking cartel that has halved its member states share of global GDP in 30 years with its ponzi scheme currency and protectionism and wrecked the lives of millions of unemployed Italians and Greeks and Spaniards thanks to the incompetence and lies of the European Commission and Council and the ECB, not to mention the EU removal of democratic leaders to suit its agenda. So when all the noise is over we will do a complete stock take on what has been achieved for our independence and sovereignty and if we've been lied to the fight will start again
1/1	I don't consider Britain a European country anymore since the EU started treating us like fools when they were the foolish ones who have put Europe in such a financial mess
1/1	I don't doubt that someone has said this earlier in this thread but I haven't read all the comments - so I say (in the words of that great patriot and Prime Minister, Winston Churchill) - this is not the end, nor is it the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. With no disrespect to our European neighbours, and with no wish to hark back to memories of earlier, more conflicted times, the 'democratic' majority of those who voted here in the UK to leave the EU have had their voices heard. Churchill also said We are with Europe, but not of it. European type politics of deals done behind closed doors has never been the way of Great Britain and the signing of treaties by successive Prime Ministers (who liked only Executive Power and who should have known better) without the expressed will of The People has, hopefully, been stymied forever. Ditto Parliaments and Speakers who think they are above and beyond the reach of the Electorate
1/1/0/0	I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
0/0	I don't hate these people nor think they're all racist. But they definitely are misguided. They will be the first to suffer as working-class voters. Where's all the huge amounts of EU funding going to come from? The Leave voters were lied to, as officially recognised by official statistics authority.
1/1/1	I don't hear many good reasons to stay that we can't do ourselves
0/0	I don't hold out much hope for the UK when ever after 2 years of negotiations people still cannot name the country they have a border with. smfh.
1/1	I don't know ANYONE who didn't know what the EU was, I don't know ANYONE who regrets their vote to leave.
1/1	I don't know if Brexit is the right decision or not, but I can at least see the reasoning behind it as well as the appeal. I'm also not a fan of the EU. I support the UK's decision either way and hope for the best.
0/1	I don't know much about the details, and it's not my country, so I don't have an especially strong opinion, but in general, I'm a fan of Brexit. National self-determination is a more fundamental political priority than any logistical or economic concerns, and it's completely reasonable for a country to want to maintain full sovereignty rather than hand it over to bureaucrats in Brussels. All the pro-EU people claiming that Britain's economy would tank upon leaving the EU are a testament to why the EU is bad. They're in effect claiming that it's a supranational organization that makes you economically dependent on itself. If the EU wants to make member states dependent upon itself for economic survival, then maybe that's a sign that it has its own best interests at heart rather than that of its member states.
1/1	I don't know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out.
1/1	I don't know where it was or under what laws we weren't allowed to attempt to trade beef or lamb with the United States or China. But there you have it in black and white from the Prime Minister. We were only allowed to trade with the EU and that is why we had to leave, that is the inference of his speech. Now we can once again trade with the rest of the world and I think a market of 6 billion is rather better than a market of 600 million, don't you?
0/0	I don't know whether Englishman are seeing this or not but they are divide and division will bring chaos .
1/1	I don't know why I'm happy but I am
1/0	I don't know your exact position but I will take a guess that ultimately this late on it is unlikely that whatever we or remain say will likely convince you one way or the other and it will probably come down to how you feel when the paper is in front of you. All I will say it is easy to just dismiss Brexit as the big risky option but before you do so, consider what Europe is likely to become in the next 5, 10, 20 years. No one can say for sure what will happen but the evidence suggests the EU will aim for greater and greater integration, possibly becoming a united states of Europe. The refugee crisis will almost certainly get worse before it gets better (only time I will touch on integration) and the problems with Greece and other economise will likely not get better for the foreseeable future.
0/0	I don't like Brexit voters
1/1/0	I don't like free movement of people into the UK.
1/1	I don't like free movement of people into the UK. I've made a fuck load trading currency, and will have no problems emigrating anywhere in Europe because of my skillset.
0/0/1	I don't like sharing this sort of video. I prefer sharing clips of reasonable Brexit voters. But #NoDealBrexit is such a threat to our country that it needs to be put down. Hard!
1/1	I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for the "United States of Europe" concept, which isn't what most of the people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union', but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be looking out for its own interests before ours.
0/1	I don't like to hold the Brexit Party to the unrealistic standard of thinking their slogans through... but after the exodus, the Israelites spent forty years wandering in the wilderness. Perhaps this was what Farage meant?
1/1	I don't mind brexit
1/-1	I don't mind brexit. If they wanted to leave they could.
1/1	I don't mind them working here, if they pay their way, work hard and aren't here illegally then they are British people. It's the illegals and the EU power lords which piss me off.
0/0	I don't often agree with a Tory. But he's right on this matter. The UK cannot make a monumental mistake and leave the EU.
1/1	I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it.
0/0	I don't really see what UK will gain from leaving the EU. I think it's better to be part of a larger union and try to improve it rather than leave it and then get screwed over.
0/1	I don't really understand what the UK is trying to do here? They wanted out of the EU. Fair enough... That's their choice. But they still want most (If not all) the benefits of being in the EU... But without giving anything back as they're no longer a member? Seems very very strange.
0/0	I don't see any facts, all I see is blind patriotism and Toxcity.
1/1	I don't subscribe to conspiracy theories as a rule but I find the media terror campaigns over Brexit highly suspicious. I have found it hard to ignore how the media tends to make such a fuss when they have an agenda and those agendas have virtually never been in the interest of the majority . The UK did the right thing leaving Brexit
0/0/0/0	I don't think Brexit is going to help people in Britain.
0/0	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK.
0/0	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK. On the other hand The UK should only stay in the EU if it wants to be in the EU. I'm not in favour of them remaining if they just remain because it's too difficult to leave.
0/0	I don't think GB realizes, that they would not just lose the trade agreements with the EU, but also the over 100 trade agreements, that the EU has with other countries.
0/0	I don't think anybody has any idea what the economic impact of Brexit will be.
0/-1/0	I don't think anyone felt opressed by the EU until the idea of Brexit was pushed on everyone
0/0/0/0	I don't think it's a good idea, personally. There's simply too much red tape, and UK citizens are bound to feel an awful lot of pain if this goes through.
0/-1/0/0	I don't think most brexiteers are under any kind of illusion that there won't be any short term chaos. But by the time any significant period of time has elapsed, and the damage becomes clear, the older voters will have died and the younger ones will have found other things to blame.
1/1	I don't think people will just completley halt trading with us once we leave the EU. Also, the EU costs us quite a lot of money (£350 million a week IIRC) which could be used for other things, like improving the NHS for both the public and the employees of it. Fair Pay for those hard-working, dedicated people has never been the same since George Osborne royally fucked over their wages.
1/-1	I don't think the Brexiteers will enjoy watching you pee all over them and their piece of shit parade, Joris. Well some of them might... but only on a Saturday night
0/0	I don't think the British people really knew the ramifications of what would happen after Brexit or not.
0/0	I don't think the UK has yet come to terms with the fact it's now a small country
0/0	I don't think the average Brit knew what they were voting for. The conservatives ginned up the fear factor, like they do here, and scared them into voting for something that is going to screw them over dearly. I can't see what's in it for the power brokers who pushed for it but conservatives usually just want to take anything that is positive for the working class and wreck it. The Repubs are still battling the 'New Deal' over here 90 years later. The Brexit deal, like most deals, is not perfect but they will regret stepping away from the EU, especially as haphazard as things are panning out now.
1/1	I don't think the deal is anywhere near good enough for the United Kingdom. I will be voting to leave the EU.
1/1	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to
1/1	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to.
0/0	I don't think we should be celebrating this. The economy is suffering and people are losing their jobs. Let's not revel in the misery of others.
0/-1	I don't think we will be going it alone. We still have good friends.
1/1	I don't trust any kind of major government which is so undemocratic (the parliament can't propose laws, those can only come from an unelected council of bureaucrats) so getting the UK out of it is needed.
0/0	I don't understand British politics. Brexit just seems like a misguided isolationist/nationalist type thing. It's like when Trump wants us to leave NATO and shuns our traditional allies. It's sad to see the global community fall apart like this.
1/1	I don't understand why Reddit is so against Brexit? The people voted. Pure democracy. Everybody wants more power to the people. It finally happened. Now Reddit is outraged. Fuck that. Having the EU in Brussels make binding agreements for people in the UK. Joke.jpg. The only reason l can think people are against it is because a right wing government is in power, if it were left wing, reddit would be praising the Brexit vote. Shows how skewed Reddit is.
1/1	I don't understand why one person thinks a country will collapse if they leave. It was the same in the states when Trump was elected all the stars said they would move to Canada big deal.
1/1	I don't understand, they haven't even tried Brexit yet, how can they complain that Tories are subverting democracy when they are pledging to do the same?
0/0/0	I don't wanna leave London is my home town fam
0/0	I don't wanna leave UK.
1/1	I don't want anything to do with the EU it is a corrupt organisation run by incompetent bureaucrats.
1/1	I don't want the UK to be just another State in the US of E.
1/1	I don't want to be ruled by a foreign power any more I don't want a leader of my country telling me lies, that we are better off being run by this foreign power,
1/1	I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
1/1	I don't want to hear the argument of immigration is good for the country
1/1	I dont even vote Conservative l, but I'm behind you on this. Don't dare quit.
1/-1	I dont have a dog in this fight, but I am so happy for the Brits.
1/1	I dont regret voting leave, and never will. Anything that shakes up the globalist elites and makes them shit their pants is good to me.
1/1	I dont understand why so many ppl that dont live in Britain think that brexit is so horrible this coming from an American but let them decide for them selves
1/1	I dont understand, there is no debate to be had here. The majority voted, end of story. 2nd referendum? Voting until you get the result that you want is not democracy
1/1	I dont want another referendum i voted out i want no deal
0/0	I don’t believe brexit is the right idea, I don't believe it will work out well. We’re turning into a laughing stock.
1/1	I don’t care if the EU needs us or not I just want to leave
1/1	I don’t have a strong opinion. I don’t educate myself on everything else going on in the world. It’s their right to leave, and I hope it works out for everyone. Edit: I’m definitely rooting for the UK, and would love to see us become even stronger allies.
0/0	I don’t know anymore!!!! UK can do very well with Europeans instead of standing alone!!!
0/0	I don’t know if it’s the whole Brexit happening today thing, or the fact I’m stressed and sleep deprived or what... but the vibes today...... disgusting
0/0	I don’t know what I can say to really express how sad and angry I am today. Rights are being wrenched away on the basis of fraud, lies and law breaking. So honestly, the #Brexit architects can stuff it where the sun don’t shine. #StillEuropean #forevereuropean
0/0/-1	I don’t know what’s worse: waking up to #Brexit, or having Jonathan Freedland at the top of my Guardian news feed.
0/0	I don’t know why, but it all sort of feels like we’re on the Titanic. The Captain is blundering on, full steam ahead. The band is playing. But kinda feels like there might be something ahead.
1/1	I don’t really see a reason for Britain to be in the EU Not my problem though
0/0	I don’t think Britain is better without Europe,reason is because 85% of business Britain do through Europe.you imagine for ones,this business we do through Europe to be with Asia Africa or us is match Moore expensive business to do.every thing imported will be doubled on price.
0/0	I don’t think that the grumpy old men and grumpy old women who swung the vote in favour of Leave care tuppence about the employment situation. They are either already retired or living a life of Riley on benefits. The drop in living standards as a direct result of the Brexit disaster is unlikely to percolate down to them for some considerable time, assuming they are still alive at that point.
0/0	I don’t think we should leave the EU
0/0/-1	I don’t understand all the details. But it seems to be one of those things where people may have shot themselves in the foot by voting to leave, perhaps not understanding all the details either. Especially when you look at the leaders who’ve been in charge of that whole thing this whole time.
0/0	I don’t want Britain to be like that one person at the party no one wants to talk to #BBCDebate #EUref #Strongerin #INtogether
0/0	I don’t want brexit to happen
1/1	I don’t want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us
1/1	I don’t want to be dragged down by the Romanian or Greek economy
0/0	I don’t want to leave & Im English
1/1	I doubt 10 years from now many people will admit to being remainers.
1/1	I doubt she (like many in the UK) likes the UK playing second fiddle to Germany alongside France in the EU very much.
0/-1	I dunno, a significant portion of the Tories general election campaign was spreading negativity
0/0	I dunno, at this point it seems like a good idea to take a step back and reevaluate the situation rather than barrel through and force a Brexit that seems to be highly unpopular.
1/1	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners
1	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners, this is a small victory that will not change anything, but hopefully this vote will have exposed all the Anti-English people currently residing in England and reaping all the benifits this country offers while spewing their hatred for everything British.
0/0	I envy you so much.....waiting for DANEXIT
1/1	I expect an explosion of prosperity in line with the Boris views.
1/1	I expect my democratic vote honoured ,a full independent Britain and nothing less. Leave now so get it done.
1/1	I expect to leave the EU. No deal is fine by me, in fact its what I voted for.
1/1/1	I favour something closer to a Norway style arrangement with the EU and therefore I would still be a Brexit supporter.
0/0	I fear any financial gains are swallowed up in the cost of the transitions , f knows how much Brexit has cost up to now . It may take decades if ever to be any ‘better off’
0/0	I fear that Theresa May's determination is turning into sheer stubborness. It is absolutely obvious that a deal will need more than two months to be concluded. What's the point in pretending to ignore it ?
0/0	I fear the BrexiTraitors will succeed in destroying the UK economy for their own financial gain.
1/0/0	I feel bad for Scotland. They should be allowed to separate from the UK. It doesn't make sense. An article said Scotland can't be separated, because they share land on the island. Ok, but what does that have to do with it? If you look at any large body of land (Europe for example), they all share the large body of land, but it is separated by country.
0	I feel bad for the average brits who have been sold a lie but since the only way out is to admit that, then the next option is to see this through to it conclusion.
0/1	I feel complete utter contempt for Brexiters. That very name will become a curse word one day
1/1	I feel good for UK leave and clean up their government.
0/-1	I feel happier if we didn't have the worst government and weakest opposition in my lifetime. There's no clear direction of travel towards Brexit, and no real attempt to debate the process.
1/1	I feel happy, I feel so sovereign now.
0/0	I feel like all the ‘leave’ folk in the comments section fail to display any form of intelligence (or literacy).
1/0	I feel like everyone is forgetting that Brexit was voted in?
0/0	I feel like it's a pretty stupid choice that seems like it will only help a select group of wealthy people while hurting most of the people who were duped into voting against their own interests.
0/0	I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians.
0/0/0	I feel like the Brexiters know it's stupid, but they stand to gain significant personal financial rewards if it goes ahead, the more chaotic the better it is for them. They simply don't care about everyone else That's the only way they could justify the lies and false claims. I'm sure there's also a factor where when you preach stupidity for long enough you do start to believe it too.
1/1	I feel like voting against leave would mean the preservation of British culture and it's charm would wade and wade until there's nothing left but a lifeless machine at the whims of Eurocrats.
1/1	I feel optimistic about Brexit. I'll take my chance living mainly an ex-pat in the EU. As I see it Brits abroad bring wealth into the Southern EU (with high unemployment) since most don't work and yet spend money and buy property - whereas the EU has exported poverty and low/unskilled workers from its East to the UK in considerably understated numbers. Brussels has everything to lose by upsetting the UK. Masks are starting to slip everywhere.
1/1	I feel physically sick when I hear Remoaners talk about job losses! We are fighting for our independence and sovereignty! WE don't care about job losses! We won two world wars! Out NOW!
0/0	I feel sad at the levels of Nationalistic celebrations, I am sure history will remember this day in a different light. On a positive note, Nigel Farage and his army of goon MEP's have now exited the EU parliament and will no longer let the British people down with their far right views and disrespect for the other members of the union.
0/0	I feel sad for the workers who are going to suffer because of Brexit. The popular discontent was never about trade--it was about xenophobia, inflamed by the far right for their own ends. But now the economy of this country will suffer massive collateral damage.
0/0	I feel sick, I feel ashamed! You stupid ignorant people! Can I now vote to stop being British??? #Britain #VoteRemain #ashamedtobeBritish
0/0	I feel so ashamed of what we’ve become reading this account from a French person driven away by Brexit. Ashamed of what we’ve become. People who have given years, decades of their lives to this country driven out by a xenophobic ideology and what it’s unleashed.
1/1	I feel so happy today, beautiful sunny day and Brits no longer being bullied by the EU! Proud of my nation, and God save the Queen. Great things to come if we all pull together.
0/0	I feel so let down by the people who could vote and decided to put their own personal hatred before others. Maybe this vote was too big for this country to handle. Throughout this all I supported remain and feel upset and angry over this result. Everyone my age will be left to deal with the consequences of this and I couldn’t even have a say in it. Evidence is showing the impact already over this, with the fall in the pound and I fear the worst is yet to come. I fail to understand why people aged 60 and above feel aggrieved by the apparent threats immigrants cause like lack of jobs and homes when they are already living comfortably with their pensions and houses when it’s young people who would be impacted by this, although I don’t personally feel like we are, yet people my age have no say.
1/1/1	I feel so proud of my country.
0/0	I feel so sad for myself to have to be born at a time like this.Can't wait to have to pay for everything! 🙄
1/1	I feel so sovereign again
0/0	I feel sorry for all the working, tax paying, rational people in the UK who wanted to remain but are going to feel the brunt of the pain from the xenophobes
1/1/-1	I feel sorry for the BBC. All their biased reporting against leaving and they still couldn’t turn the public. Probably because most people don’t even watch the rubbish they churn out !
0/0	I feel sorry for your country. Good luck, you guys are going to need it.
1/0	I feel strongly that your country's insistence that somehow everything is to blame on 1 woman is a giant copout and part of the exact kind of thinking that got you in this mess: Short sighted, polarized and lacking any sort of nuance whatsoever.
1/1	I feel such pride that we are now an independent country again. We will flourish!
0/0	I feel that it has been proven time and again by history that making far reaching decisions on the basis of nationalist egotism,like we are seeing so often today and not just with Brexit, is not going to end well.
1/1	I feel that the EU needs to either fully federalise or draw back into a looser confederation
1/1	I feel that when Britain leaves the EU we will be a shining example of an economy for most of Europe to emulate.
0/0	I feel that you are trying to be too gentle with this topic. The bank of England predicted 10% GDP loss during next 10 years, the british pound might have as well been renamed the british stone after leave referendum, the figures Brexiteers give are plain fake. UK needs EU more than the other way around, and Brexit, from an economics perspective, is a horrible idea.
0/0	I feel the US and UK are mirroring each other. Bad choices. Bad policy. Bad actors.
0/0	I feel the leave campaign is purely built on a combination of speculation and bullshit. Remain on the other hand relies on information we have, and we all live in at the moment- which really isn't that bad.
0	I feel unrepresented.
0/0	I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. #BrexitDay
0/-1	I felt sick when I woke up that morning and really just sad
1/1	I felt that the UK’s membership in the EU was putting both her own citizens as well as non-EU foreigners in the UK at an unfair disadvantage against EU citizens
0/1	I find it embarrassing the level to which those without facts will stoop to rubbish the other side's argument. There are precious few facts, and it's nowhere near clear cut one way or the other. I am therefore hoping voter apathy doesn't occur because people really DO need to make their views heard, and I would expect a higher turnout than at the general election. Personally, i'm voting IN. This is for a few reasons: 1) I'm a small business owner, and those saying OUT either have large businesses that would weather the impending economic storm or have no visibility of what it would be. Conversely I can see from our revenues the difference between a confident and shaky economy, and it's scary wondering how i'm going to pay my staff whilst this shakes out (if the Brexiters win). 2) I have a non-EU wife, and the levels of PITA filling out Visa applications when I want to visit her parents or vice versa is a massive massive ballache, and I don't think the Brexiters have factored this in. 3) Any side featuring Farage and Britain First needs to be countered in any shape or form. 4) Boris's opposition is purely a PM play.
0/1	I find it hilarious that May is threatening not to pay the biggest power in Europe, when in fact we can MAKE you pay by various means of taxation and customs rules. EU holds all the cards, you have nothing but empty pride.
0/0/-1	I find it mildly amusing that remainers somehow think their tragic lives will be in the slightest bit affected by the outcome of any final negotiation. When you’ve got nothing already you can lose nothing.
0/0	I find it really sad most of all. Because it seems like a such a clusterfuck of a situation with no winners.
0	I find it ridiculous that so many people in the UK want brexit. After all half of their trade is with the EU, if they leave they could really hurt themselves and so far nothing negative has forced the UK to leave, they were doing fine in the EU before hand, if it ain't broken don't fix it.
0/0	I find it sad that nearly 75% of 18-24 year olds voted to stay, yet the main demographic of the leave campaign was over 50s. Old deciding the future of the young.
1	I find it unbelievable that the Labour Party, including Northamptonshire Labour Party County councillors, support a second referendum. We had a ‘People’s Vote’ back in 2016 in which 58.6% of ‘Daventry’ voted to leave the European Union. I will do everything I can to see this through and will never accept a second referendum.
1/1	I firmly believe that the EU as currently structured is doomed to failure.
1/1/1	I for one can't wait to finally leave the corrupted EU, to make our own laws/rules , in recent months alls we've seen is threats and bullying from the likes of macron, Michel Barnier and the other fools, It reaffirms why so many of us voted for Brexit in the first place. It's just a shame that we have in fighting in our political parties , the people made there choice to leave and it should be respected instead of everyone pulling in different directions. The EU is a failing economic model. Britain has been one of the leading countries in the world for half a millennia and we have done this because of our ingenuity and capabilities, not because we have been lead by bureaucrats. Project fear is in full swing with media outlets suggesting that we'll struggle with food and medicine amongst other things , it's a big world out there and with the likes of the US, Canada and Australia saying they will be glad to do more business with us I'm excited for the future of the UK away from EU bureaucrats . RULE BRITTANIA
1/1	I for one will welcome the return of more powerful hoovers when we finally leave!
0/1	I found this quite interesting from Brexit supporter Geoff Norcott!
0/0	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event.
0/0	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event. Edit: Some of my reasons for staying: 1) Better employment rights: minimum paid annual leave (currently at 28 days) 2) The current pregnant and paternity leave rights. May not be perfect but it's improved. 3) Fighting equal pay across the sexes. 4) Anti- discrimination rules in the workplace On the above 4 points it has been noted that the UK didn't want. I'm not saying the above laws wouldn't have happened anyways, but they may have occurred later (if at all), if the UK got its way. 5) Thanks to the EU roaming fees are a lot less. I don't have to buy a new SIM card each time I visit a European country and then inform everyone of a temporary new number. Businesses don't have to suffer as a result of having to change numbers in the midst of a deal when they go abroad. People at home can much easily contact you in an emergency as they can just message/call your existing mobile number. People who aren't aware you are abroad can still get in contact with you via phone if need be. 6) Standardisation of phone chargers. I imagine this would have happened eventually, but it was forced by the EU. All radio equipment (such as mobiles, locating beacons, cameras) are supposed to now use a micro usb. Think of the times you've not had a charger and needed one? 7) Schengen. 8) Ability to go anywhere in the EU to work and live freely with ease. If I wanted to work in France I am to be treated exactly as their home citizens, and not be disadvantaged by being foreign. 9) You can retire anywhere in Europe and still claim a British pension. 10) whilst abroad I can receive emergency healthcare for free via the EHIC scheme. 11) If I encounter flight delays or cancellations whilst in the EU, airlines have to compensate and accommodate me. This is not true (I believe) of the USA. 12) As an EU citizen if I face trouble abroad and cannot find a British embassy I am entitled to turn up at any EU embassy and they have to provide consular services. 13) The EU has introduced a number of consumer rights (the aforementioned cap on roaming fees) and a two year garuntee on all products. If we were to leave the EU, Chinese manufacturers may not make products sent to the UK to the same standard of the rest of the EU. These may not be arguments based on the economy or immigration and I've deliberately tried to stay away from that. I'm looking at things that affect me on a day to day basis and that is why I said my statement.
1/0	I genuinely believe the EU is going to become the USA of Europe
1/0	I genuinely like your videos but you cited all the things that could go wrong with leaving the EU and none of the benefits. That is called Bias.
1/1	I get the feeling that the Remtards still don't realise that they have lost and that we are actually leaving the corrupt Ponzi scheme that is the EU. We need a grand gesture to make them aware of what losers they are and something that will keep reminding them. I think a knighthood for Nigel Farage would do the trick
1/1/1	I get very tired of Brexit deniers saying no one vote to Brexit thinking they’d be poorer. I voted Brexit regardless. I think that’s true of most brexiteers.
0/0	I give it week.... until their economy collapses
1/1	I give the EU 5 years tops. How long can two or three Countries bankroll 24 others?
1/1	I glad I voted out
1/1	I got sick and tired of the constant political meddling - not just from Brussels, but our own politicians telling us how wonderful that meddling is. We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise. My area in particular has turned into Little Bucharest since the cap on Romanian/Bulgarian migration was lifted in 2014 and if you read any of the local press, reports of rapes, thefts, drink driving, the occasional murder (yes, really), and the perpetrator is very likely going to be called something like "Florian Iliescu" or "Elena Sandu". I was walking home one night and there were two police officers stood talking next to their cars outside the scene of what appeared to be a burglary, and I overheard one of them saying "... yeah, the Romanians really haven't been behaving themselves around here lately ..." Life here is too easy. We are too soft a touch and the government deliberately refused to apply the brakes available to them - if migration had been properly controlled and managed instead of letting in everyone without checks, a lot more people would have gone remain. Everyone aspires to get to "England" and I guess countries like France and Belgium are third-world warzones these days.
1/0	I grew up in a British colony but I was of germanic/Indian extract. Now I am living in Europe in my mother country. Growing up the British always got non British people to feel bad about themselves. Nothing overt but just enough to make one feel that you are inadequate. From India to Africa to the Caribbean you have a group of people that always felt that they were somehow less. It freaks me out. Now you have people like Johnson, Fox, Davis prancing around and actually manifesting that idea of supposed British superiority making others feel inadequate. The British view of themselves does not correlate with actual perception. I want the British humiliated not out of spite but rather because it seems that it's the only way to get through the self agrandisation. The next elephant in the room to be discussed is the UN security council seat. Rationally it is something that the UK should willingly concede to India. The British are represented by the USA they have no right to it.
0/0	I guess a lot of Remainers will need help packing as they prepare to move to an EU country!
0/0	I guess no the uk can became even more inbred
0/0	I guess nobody is surprised by this obvious act of xenophobia because this is EXACTLY WHAT the Brexiters voted for. Afterall, they elected Boris Watermelon Smile Letterbox Johnson to be their PM.Hence, I will never unite nor support this xenophobic racist Brexit.
1/-1	I had a brexit party yesterday it was pretty cool ngl but everyone had to leave at 11PM
1	I had a few (discussions) with some of the younger members of my family over the past 2 years. Having seen the pantomime created by the remainers and their remain at any cost stance they now agree that we should leave. Same goes for Corbyn he was the best thing since sliced bread 18 months ago. Now he's seen for what he is. Someone who puts his socialist agenda before country
1/1	I had a smoke with nigel Farage at CPAC in 2019. Hes a good guy
1/0	I had hoped that after 31st January 2020, the remain voting faction of the UK, would at least stop spouting the acidic vitriol we have had to listen to for 4 years. However, my hope was in vain; it seems their never-ending bile is very much still present - one only has to take a minute to read their comments on the threads of the DT's articles. I fear this is just going to get worse as we endeavour to strike-up trade deals, as we know the EU will do everything in their power to make life as difficult as possible for us during this transition period. We know this, and expect nothing less from them. It is why we chose to leave the unscrupulous bloc. Daniel, maybe there are those who voted to remain who have now accepted the inevitable, but if the comments on here are anything to go by, there are those who never will.
0/0	I hate #brexit and the #conservative lie “protecting sovereignty”, whilst selling off sovereignty.
0/0	I hate Brexit so much, i voted leave but i just wish i never hear about Brexit ever again.
0/0	I hate all this crap the Government are doing because stupid people didn't think things through. My thoughts are with you and everyone else who is in this situation, and all the other subsets of society they will round on when you have left this unpleasant shitstream of a nation.
1/0	I hate how everything is just going to be more expensive now
1/1	I hate immigrants. Leave now
0	I hate it and i'm embarrassed by the whole ordeal. You're voting to leave? Well you must be a racist. Voting to stay? You obviously don't care about your country and it's people. It's a farce. There has been zero facts and the whole thing has been fueled by attacks on the other campaign, rather than defending their own. We're being asked to make a huge decision without being given any solid facts whatsoever. If we can't discuss the issue like grown ups then they shouldn't be discussing it at all.
1/1	I hate the EU. They let our enemies in on mass. As far as I'm concerned the European council and parliament, and every institution they created can burn.
0/0	I hate the prospect of Brexit, and if I was old enough at the time would have voted remain. However, wishing death or ill will on anyone simply because they do not share your view (52% of the population) is disgusting.
1/-1	I have a lot of friends here. It’s a great political year in America. So I expect to be here a bit
1/1	I have a new respect for my cousins across the pond . Farage , we need people like you in the U.S Congress !! Come here ! Cheers & Beers
0/-1/0	I have a question, what happens the 2 million or so Brits living abroad, especially the ones in Europe (I am one of these) I work, and live in Finland, as we are part of the EU I am entitled to do so, I pay y taxes to Finland, yet hold a British Passport, I could if pushed claim a Finnish passport I have been here for 10 years, but why should I have to?
0/0	I have absolutely no doubt that there were many people who made a well thought out, educated decision about leaving & I genuinely respect that. But truth be told, the vast majority who voted leave did so out of a primitive patriotism & with no understanding of the implications.
1/1	I have always recognised the benefits of being part of the EU, however I do not believe in centralisation of power. Being from just outside Belfast I cannot see how a foreign government can effectively legislate for many diverse regions
0/0	I have always said Britain is the most reluctant country to change, modernise and update. Brexit is a prime example-It shows a country that refused to acknowledge that its empire was dead and never to be resurrected. It shows a country unwilling to co operate with a system it cannot rule over. It shows that it needs to rely upon nostalgia for its basic existence. It shows a country that has an education system straight out of the Victorian age. Britain is a an example of what happens when you fail to understand the world.
1/1	I have always said we should walk away and if they want a trade deal they can come to us!
1/-1	I have been in business for more than 30 years..if my most important customer requested better trading terms .. then we would listen...and discuss in an open manner....however the European bunch are devoid of common business sense....we learnt many years ago ...the art of negotiation is silence.....its an all time winner Boris...we do have it.. the Euros .. do not....use it.. It works.
1/1	I have decided we are going to colonise the Galápagos Islands & turn them into a penal colony. Sent there will be, Republicans, Scottish Nationalists, & people who visit Blackpool through the holiday season! Let’s make the British Empire Great again! #Brexit
0/0	I have felt European since I first set foot on the mainland 75 years ago, so am deeply disappointed as are many of us
0/0	I have gone the other way, I just want the EU to completely fuck us over now, crash out with a no deal and no other trade deals in place, just a complete cluster fuck. Then maybe people will understand that voting for nonsense doesn't work
1/1	I have hope this decision changes UK, and changes EU, maybe make other countries exit
1/1	I have hundreds of friends and not one has changed their minds on leaving the Cartel. In fact, they are more resolute on leaving.
0/1	I have just done a Brexit (No, not a poo, potty mouths!) I could not find my engagement ring, panic ensued. Looked everywhere for it, thinking my beautiful ring must be somewhere else. But it was on my finger all the time, close to home, I just needed to look properly #Brexit
1/1	I have many times in my life been against the outcome of a general election, but I don't immediately demand and plot for a re-run.
0/0/0	I have never felt less British. For those who voted out due to immigration, maybe they forgot who treats them when they are ill, or teaches their children, or keeps their area clean, they are ignorant to how much many immigrants contribute to our society. I am incredibly scared about the prospect of my future. Who knows if my parents will be able to afford for me to go to university? The imminent fall of the pound suggests further economic downfall, my future was left in the hands of people who I’ve never met, whilst the 16- and 17-year-olds of the country, on the edge of our future, were not allowed to vote and now have been left isolated on our tiny island. Just like all my friends now, I am close to tears, the prospect of such a severe unknown is so unnerving and I feel like we’ve already begun to fall apart. I think we’re all acutely aware that had 16-year-olds been allowed to vote, it would have been a different outcome. Please pray for our futures.
1/1/1/1	I have never had any sort of 2nd thought. I voted out because I am thoroughly sick of the EU - an anti-democratic genocidal construct designed to erase nation states and alter their genetic make-up. When you see people like Blair and Merkel getting the EU's Kalergi prize you know that is true - if you don't know what the Kalergi plan is, look it up.
1/1	I have never heard such ignorance. This idiot just stood on that stage and insulted everyone who voted to leave the EU. There is nothing wrong with nationalism and wanting to control your country's borders.
1/1	I have never seen so many stupid people all in one place ( although there was only one brain cell ). WE voted out and now there are more countries of the world to trade with than there was being locked into Europe. The one thing this country lacks is patience they act like Americans we want it all and we want it now ...............well things do not happen like that we have voted we are leaving Europe so back off and wait for the out come like the MOST of us that voted to leave. I do not care how we leave they will need us more that we need them. Europe was full of corruption ripping us off and it went to the very top.
0/0	I have never thought that the Brexit result was legitimate. It was always a right wing Anglo American billionaire led coup. It is about ruling us more effectively by the Tory right wing.
0/0	I have no confidence in Western Civilization anymore... Brexit, France, Russia and Trump..  Its time for me to move Australia..
1/1	I have no regrets what so ever. The EU is moving closer and closer to becoming a federation.
0/0	I have no words for those who voted Brexit
0/0	I have not been following this very closely, as we have so many problems here at home. Just seems to me though that this is not a really great idea. Boris Johnson appears to be cut from the same cloth as Donnie Trump and that is not a compliment. Go ahead! Make your comments! I admit I'm not that well informed!
1/1	I have not changed my mind about brexit at all. Undemocratic multi-millionaires and celebrities are telling me it's a big mistake and the country will be destroyed. These are the same people with houses in France and Italy and bank accounts in Switzerland.
1/1	I have nothing against foreigners, But look what happened years ago when Enoch Powell said no to foreigners coming into the country, all parties kicked him out, Now look what has happened, the uk won't be the uk any more if we stay in and will end up having a foreign flag flying over us instead of our union jack.
0/0	I have one finger on each hand reserved for Brexit and the Senate. I’ll let you guess which ones.
0/0	I have one question for the mentally deficient people who voted for unicorns. Name me one EU law which you don't like. Apart from wonky bananas and laws which have actually been made by English politicians and judges.
1/1	I have one thing to say: E.U. sucks and it is making the world worst
1/1	I have reluctantly voted to leave (I have worked for the EU and seen enough).
1/1	I have said all along they are terrified of losing control over us. With May this wasnt a problem as Selmayr was heard to say but the landscape has now changed.
0/1	I have so far met two people who said they regretted their vote to REMAIN!
0/0/0	I have the same reasoning as someone from the north of England. Northern cities receive so much funding from the EU while Westminster would rather see us rot. So much regeneration in places like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle came about because of Objective One EU funding. I'm scared that leaving will bring about another Thatcherite annihilation of the north.
0/0	I have to applaud any MP that displays such passion in defence of their constituency. Brexit is a clear failure with no decent compromise except at the expense of those of us dwelling at the bottom. This needs to stop. May has failed and all others that follow will too.
0/-1	I have to snicker a bit to myself at that last guy. He seems to be offering some "middle ground", by making the MP's vote for something that the EU has repeatedly said, will not happen. The free movement of people is a cornerstone of the entire concept of the EU, and having the UK be an exception to that rule would be a really dangerous precedent that could encourage other nations to leave as well. It is not in the interest of Brussels to make this easy on the UK, rather to the contrary, it is in their interest to make sure Britain comes out of this worse off that they would be inside the EU. It is completely up to the UK whether it stays in the EU or not, but don't expect them to treat you nicely after moaning to them for several decades and then spitting in their face. You might have been an empire in the past, but you are going up against a 15 trillion dollar trading block. You are not the bigger fish here.
0/-1	I have travelled quite a bit around the UK in the last few months: Scotland, Northern Ireland, South West England, Wales, London. I have stayed all over the country in middle range accomodation (quite good by the way) and eaten in many restaurants (equaly good). I would say at a rough estimate that 90 % of the staff are not UK born: I have been looked after by very nice and efficient people from Poland, Spain, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, France, Greece, Italy and probably numerous other countries. Who is going to take their place if Britain leaves the EU?
0/0	I have tried and tried to find positive but Brexit scares me so much I can’t help it, I am British AND European and will always be no matter what.
0/0	I have yet to find anything that, to me, would justify leaving, but there are plenty of things to be critical of the EU for. I have found the attempts to try and regulate every single thing frustrating, as logic is often missed. I have also been annoyed that they neutered paint stripper, due to H&S or something, meaning I can't get good liquid/gel paint stripper now and have to watch in sadness at the nice stuff in America (admittedly more toxic but fine if you use precautions) Recently they have gone back to wanting to ban halogen lightbulbs, this would pretty much kill the small theatre industry. So yeah, there are things I feel the EU does wrong, and aspects of the organisation that are frustrating, but it would be better to be in than out. We are only going to get screwed over by leaving.
0/0	I have yet to hear a convincing argument for the Leave side. I really get the in impression thay it's mostly just xenophobia driving it. Also, from my limited understanding, Scotland and Borthern Ireland are getting fucked pretty hard by this. Also, i feel bad for May. I think she inherited a dumpster fire here. I hope that in the next couple weeks the government decides to have another referendum, or better yet just collectively agree to forget this whole thing happened.
0/0	I have yet to meet any normal people on the continent who think keeping the UK is worthwhile. Please go off by yourself and sink your miserable, sad country, Brexit is really the UK unable to accept it is no longer very important.
0/0	I have yet to see one single positive thing to come from us leaving the EU, except some BNP, sorry Tory donors will avoid some very large tax declarations....
0/0/0	I haven't heard any Leave MPs saying that Brexit will be a success for about a year to 15 months now. Certainly it's considered common knowledge that we'll all be poorer., with less opportunities - and that it will especially hurt the poor. No-one even debates that any more.
1/0/-1/-1/-1	I haven't met any racist remain voters. Just like I've met plenty of leave voters who aren't racist.
1/1	I haven't met anyone who regrets their leave vote.  No regrets from me.
0/0	I haven’t seen that many White Nationalists since Trump’s last Hate Rally.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders. The fact that the British government has done everything it could to sabotage the will of the British public is just another example of the establishment wanting the pretense of democracy to keep people placid, but constantly undermining their own country for their own power and benefit.
1/-1	I hold a rosy view of Britain’s future outside of the EU.
0/0	I honestly can't say this enough but fuck brexit, fuck British insular attitudes, fuck the UK union and fuck the Westminster government twats. My country didn't want this. My country didn't vote for this and our people deserve fucking better #LeaveALightOnForScotland
1/1	I honestly can't stop grinning since Brexit day
0/0	I honestly don't think this will make any difference including the immigration problem people seemed to mainly vote for.
0/0	I honestly hope all the people who supported this stupid nonsense never speak or vote again and basic common sense can return...
1/1	I honestly think the UK, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands can survive without the EU.
1	I honestly thought by the headline I was going to learn what’s next! What a waste of an article
1/1	I hope Brexit hurts the EU and gives it the kick up the ass it deserves.
1/1/1	I hope Brexit will deliver and succeed the Democratic vote...
0/0	I hope Brexit wrecks the UK and dim witted Brexit voters suffer the most. You deserve it.
0/0	I hope Britain does NOT leave the EU. Make the EU relationship work for you
1/1	I hope Britain makes it out of the EU to show the way for the other countries. I am pro European, but the EU nowadays is not
0/0	I hope Britain suffers. It's about time that history punishes them.
0/-1	I hope EU dont accepts any comprehensive deal with UK. Otherwise other countries in the EU will think they can do the same. Actually EU has to make their life miserable:) Now UK and their people can live their dreams without EU :)
0/0	I hope EU will punish UK badly for such a horrible idea as Brexit. EU cannot afford spreading the idea of leaving the EU among its members.
1/1	I hope England gets independence
0/0/0	I hope Europe gets more prosperous as a result.
1/1	I hope May's deal is voted down. The only acceptable outcome is a no-deal Brexit.
0/1	I hope Scotland secedes from the UK.

0/0	I hope UK stay in EU. Im brazilian but i admire the European Union. Each coutry is better being part of it than alone i think.
0/0	I hope after voting to stay in the EU, the UK joins the Eurozone and let go of their outdated currency and join the 21st century. It will also make vacations in Europe easier and more efficient.
0/0	I hope for Scotland to declare independence from England and remain part of the EU.
0/0	I hope it fails and the UK has to go back
0/-1	I hope my country Turkey will join to the EU soon
0	I hope one of those Brexit leaders like Boris take over and realize how fuckin stupid and unrealistic it is to expect to an awesome deal from the EU to leave. Take responsible for your own goddamn actions.

0/0	I hope people starve and are unable to get their necessary medicines as a result of Brexit.

0/0	I hope the EU punishes UK so that other nations don't follow Britain.
0/-1	I hope the EU tell them where to go!!nowhere!
0/1	I hope the U.K does leave the E.U, I'm just not sure where it leaves Irish citizens, I've worked in the U.K for 5 years. I mean every generation of Irish people because of economic circumstances here in Ireland were forced to go work in the U.K, long before any EEC-EU. Cameron was forced into having this referendum because of his own party and I think Cameron is fearful of the rise and support of U.K.I.P, we also share a land border with the "UK" 40 miles away, and 20 minute drive I am technically in the U.K. While consider the north of Ireland to be part of the Island of Ireland, I work with both currencies the euro, and sterling.
1/1	I hope the corrupt EU burns and crashes
0/0	I hope the option of no brexit is still possible
0/0	I hope the people of the north, especially the traditional manufacturing, mining towns etc, get the brexit they deserve and I've got a feeling that's exactly what's about to happen.They will only have themselves to blame unfortunately.
0/0	I hope the worst of the business failures & job losses happen in the Brexiteer areas. They voted Brexit, they should get to feel the consequences of their actions
0/0	I hope their is a 2nd vote now the lies of the #Leave campaign have been revealed. #Brexit #EUref #VoteRemain
1/0/0	I hope they are required a visa to come to Europe in their holidays
1/1	I hope they ban these EU trolls from posting on these comment boards in the near future. They've surely outlived their usefulness. To my fellow Brexiteers, I wish you a Happy UK independence Day,
1/1	I hope they get out, European Union is trash, especially coming after Google
1/1/1/1	I hope they leave
0/0/-1	I hope they say no too. Fed up of the me me me attitude
1/1	I hope this is the start of the "Domino effect".. Enough wasted hard working tax payers money given to the EU gravy train.
1/1	I hope those english leave very fast
0/0	I hope to God that this ends well. But in the hands of Boris Farage, I worry.
1/1	I hope we come out of the EU. Its what I voted for.
1/1	I hope we do leave the Eu, nothing wrong with what these people are saying don't know why everyone has got to bash them based on it, at the end of the day the leave v stay polls at the moment are very close so no point giving these people crap because there's plenty of us that feel this way
0/1	I hope you say 'great day' in the following months!!!!
0/0	I hope you stay, greetings from Germany
1/1/1	I hope, that EU will disintegrate.
0/0	I just curious to know how uk will strive economically after this
0/0	I just curious to know how uk will thrive economically after this doesnt seem possible
1/1	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European.
1/1	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European. And I am afraid that that may happen
1/0	I just don't get why people aren't talking about the fact that britain simply VOTED on leaving the EU, they never actually left. Brexit isn't the main reason for this economic event
0/0	I just don’t think I really believed it would happen.... now I’m terrified it actually will. I mean how can something with no tangible benefits and a massive loss of personal freedoms actually happen
1/1	I just don’t think that Islam is compatible with the west. I just don’t think that people who believe in child marriage and terrorism should be in the United Kingdom, or Europe for that matter. That book poses a threat, and as long as that book exists there will never be peace in the west.
0	I just emigrated.
0/0	I just feel grief. I'm almost certain it'll be a no deal disaster at this point and that my generation are well and truly ruined. We're going to be the people shouldering the 2nd great depression, and the worst part is it's entirely the elderly's fault.
1/1	I just got trolled by a German who told me, "Prepare to eat tinned food only." I had to set him straight that I'm Scottish and there's more sheep and cows than people here. Massive fail! Rather like the EU generally.
1/1	I just hope Britain can get back it's culture. It's such a shame that so much of Britain has been taken over. I pray that they will stay independent. Good for them.
0/1	I just hope that now EU will isolate somehow UK from the rest of the Europe so they can enjoy what they wanted.
1/1	I just love the genuine hurt and salt from continentals. It's hilarious how naive you all are about this. All you people have done is make the same tired arguments, same crappy jokes about the delay, without realising your superstate government literally caused it. When Donald Tusk stood down he admitted to doing everything in his power to stop Brexit, and left a message for all the remoaners telling them to "never give up". What does that say? The EU love meddling with our democracy. They really really REALLY had the upper hand when our government had no majority. We had one of the weakest and most incompetent conservative leaders as well, Boris did what she couldn't in 3 years. It's hilarious how blind you truly are. You think we're going to crash and burn because of Brexit. Because we'll be leaving an undemocratic political hub. You think our economy is going to crash but why would it? We spend more of our GDP than we get out, not only that, but we're one of the five global powers. What reason does our economy have to suffer? Oh, and "most of our trade comes from the EU", wow really??? I never knew that, I truly wonder why we voted to leave. All you faggots have done is point and laugh at us in the process, talking about this like it's a comedy series, making naive remarks about more delay, now look. We've actually left. It's like what Nigel Farage said "you all laughed at me at the beginning, but in 2016 you stopped." Of course the scaremongering won't stop though. You'll still carry on fretting about our economy crashing for X reason, Y goods being of poor quality. Or our 300 year old union breaking up. Well keep telling yourself that. I will enjoy licking the salty tears of continentals that make the same tired arguments now that we're leaving. Or better yet the doublely braindead TLDR viewer base.
1/1	I just voted Leave to get the Muslims out
0/0	I just want to put out there that I totally get it if Scotland wants independence from the #Brexit shitshow that is the U.K., and whether they are part of the U.K. or not they are our neighbours (and colleagues in my case) and I bloody love you.
1/1	I just want to see us in control of our own destiny.
1/1/1	I just want us to leave the eu, no deal will do!!
0/0	I just watched Barnier and he didn't demand anything, he said it is up to the UK to decide what it wants to do. Rubbish inflammatory Mail headline and the mug Brexiteers fell for it yet again
0/0	I kinda feel bad for Theresa May. She was basically made the captain of a sinking ship where the previous captain held a vote on whether or not to sink the ship and then took the only lifeboat when, lo and behold, people voted to sink the ship. Now she's in a position where she obviously doesn't want the ship to sink, but no one can agree on how to patch the holes.
1/1/1/1/1	I knew exactly what I was voting for and still do not regret my vote to leave, in fact I want out more than ever before. I have not met one leave voter that has changed their mind or regrets their vote.
0/0	I know 52% voted for brexit, but times has changed since then and people have allready seen the effects now. As i see it, even with the corruption of the EU parlament, it is STILL worth it for britain to stay in EU.
0/0	I know I talk smack about #brexit but it's actually the most ridiculous thing to happen. It was a populist and immature move my Cameron and now Britain WILL absolutely suffer. I also know that all my friends / family and normal minded people voted #remain
1/1	I know brexit is frustrating and scary, but it's out of the box now. It won't go back in. We can either move through it, or be messing about with it for the next decade, perhaps even crashing out with no deal after all.
0/0	I know it is hard for Brexiters to understand that many on the continent value other things than just cash. Like belonging to a union of equals. Like having rights over a whole continent. Like cooperating.
0/-1	I know it's a joke but isn't this an example of what Brexiteers mean when talking about sovereignty? Continually having to get EU's permission and how they limit us by denying us what we want to do?
0/0	I know it's not at the top of everyone else's list but there's one topic which never gets enough coverage in this debate: UK citizens like me who live and work in the EU. I read the other day that there could be 2 million of us. Many of us would be at risk of losing our jobs and homes, and needing to arrange complex paperwork for spouses and families just to repatriate (which, incidentally, is not something I want to do). It feels like we're faced with the choice of applying for citizenship in our host countries or risk losing everything. Quite apart from that, imagine the pressure on the job market, etc, if many of us are forced to return.
1/1	I know it's not easy for upper middle class metropolitan elite types to lose to the riff raff that we all know you really think the rest of us are, but that you lost the argument, after investing so much in trying to win it. But this should be a wake up call, that involves some self reflection, but instead there has been an increase in the amount of trolling of your somewhat antagonistic views, that you inflict on the rest of us.
0/0	I know it's not very "politically correct" to say it out loud but in the wasteland of ruined Britain I am going to hunt and eat old people
0/0/0	I know lying worked to get us out of the EU but a bit less obvious next time.
1/-1	I know most other people don't like EU because they feel the culture from their country will fade
1/1	I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success.
0/0	I know this is trivial compared with the other reported disastrous outcomes of leaving the EU...
0/0	I know two people who voted in 2016 for BREXIT have since died. Why should the current population suffer the consequences? This is not democracy it is stupidity.
0/0	I know very little about UK politics, but anyone who looks like Trump with a bowl cut can’t be good....
1/-1	I know what my father would have done to a traitor like Cooper if this was during WW2.
1/1	I laugh you:)))))economical level of turkey and salaries are better in turkey than in uk. please make more research.
0	I leave Downing Street 10 times more skeptical than I was before
0/1	I like how you're comparing Brexiteers to drug-dealing university rejects. And we all know xenophobic drug dealers are the worse kind.
0/1	I like the EU's version of a level playing field as long as they are a bit higher than the UK
0/0	I like the fact that all those Leavers are publicising the fact on their personal timelines that most of us want to Remain 🙂
0/-1	I like the idea of peace but with different economic laws and values and some not using the euro
0/-1	I like the idea of the EU and despite wide spread calls for reform they seem to fall on death ears
1/1	I like the idea of the EU and despite wide spread calls for reform they seem to fall on death ears. Whilst I agree that staying in it is the best way to achieve reform, ultimately its needs a catalyst and Brexit might achieve this.
1	I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.

0/0	I like to feel more European then Brittish
1/1	I like what you say Mr Johnson , dont let us down , we believe in you !
0/0	I liked someone say in a comments section of a Brexit related video that Brexit is a warning what happens if one's ego and IQ are inversely proportional
0/0	I listen to 'Ruin My Life' by Zara Larsson when I think of Brexit
0/0	I live in Finland and i buy English stuff, but not any more if brexit happens
0/0	I live in France for a British company so I see all perspectives of this. Therefore my conclusion is for the UK to leave the EU is pure madness, and the UK would be hurt most of all.
0/0	I live in Scotland and I voted to remain within the EU. In fact the whole of Scotland voted to remain within the EU
0/0	I live in Wales, we are more supported by the EU than by London. There's really no contest about which way to vote if you're in Wales or NI. Stay. If leave hits then it's just going to be a matter of time before Scotland leaves the UK and then it'll be time for Wales to campaign to do so as well. Also, not needing a visa to go visit Europe? That's just amazing, I wouldn't want to give that up for the world. Edit: Inbox replies disabled. I've written a very abbreviated version of what I think and feel with generalisations with this message and I don't want to get drawn into a debate or a discussion.
1/1/1	I live in a 'Labour heartland' and I can tell you that the main reason for leaving Labour is immigration. Blair opened the doors and changed communities. People are open but too many came at once.
0/0	I live in a true blue Tory borough in Surrey. Lib Dem's are the only party to say no to brexit! They've got my vote.
1/1	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country
1/1/1/1/1/1	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country.
1/0	I live in the middle of nowhere and get absolutely fuck all from being in the EU
0/0	I lived in England for five years back in the 80s and loved it. Kills me to see it turn to shit over ignorance.
0/0	I lived there for 20 years when the vote came around it was spun around in immigration. Many voted leave because they honestly thought that they're would not be any more immigration into the country. This is the reason Boris did not want a revote recently. It's a sad day
0/0	I long back to how bad I thought Brexit would turn out one year ago. One year on and somehow there seems to be even less of a plan and those in charge seem to have even less of a clue what they are doing.
0/0	I look at this and think, im so glad to live in the netherlands and be part of an actual working economic union called THE EU, have a nice life try not to die UK peeps
1/1	I look forward to the UK reclaiming its sovereignty and sense of independent freedom come 29th March 2019. Rule, Britannia!
1/1	I love Brexit
1/1	I love Britain and desperate to save it for my future generation by leaving EU.
0/0	I love Brits, snobbery and all but I think they're going to learn a hard lesson, here.
0	I love Europe and I love the EU as its legislation makes it easy to look for opportunities outside your own country. I shall always be pro-EU. I ought to have been born some 40 years later in order to fully enjoy the possibilities that the EU offers. I thank all the EU countries and send my warmest regards from Finland:)
0/0	I love Europe and I loved the freedom we once had to just pop in from time to time. Personally, Brexit has meant that my future career plans are very much balanced on a knife edge.
1/1	I love Europe, but I hate the EU and the Brussel bureaucrats telling us what to do and when to do it with our own money. The EU is un-democratic.
0/0	I love being in the EU, I don't want UK to leave it.
0/0	I love free shipping, i love immigrants
0/0	I love free shipping. Stop brexit now
1/1	I love how the video is titled in a way that tries to put in peoples mind that Britain lost something...no the EU lost something.. a part of it literally removed itself.
1/1	I love remainers telling thicko leavers what they didn’t vote for- but as thick as we are we can smell a rat on Norway, 2nd ref. and extension of article 50 to discuss deal- what we did vote to do was LEAVE - and none of the above does that. As we say up north Let’s get gone!
0/0	I love that Leavers talk about this issue in terms of winners and losers!... No one won anything, in brexit we all lose together as country.
1/-1	I love the Brits. They’ve nailed acting rudely in their politeness, and politely in their rudeness “HARUMPH, I SAY! HARUMPH!” “Orrdahhhh!!! (Order)”
0/0	I love the nationalistic hypocrisy that’s rolling up here. The former Great Britain was great because of its colonies and everything that scavenge from there. If leaving EU is the next big thing in their agenda that will only bring isolation and provocation to the rest of the world to apply “special regime” for British nationals.
1/1	I love the smell of Liberal tears in the morning .......smells like Victory. Make it a double in November Americans; then time to Liberate Europe AGAIN!!!
0/0	I love the stale reek of Brexit in the morning
0/0/0	I loved my British Heritage. Now I’m embarrassed that I have such racist countrymen.
0/0	I mean ... the loss of freedom of movement is catastrophic for my industry. No Googling needed, just a massive reduction in working opportunities and income for us all.
0/0	I mean for my age, I guess I shouldn't be too concerned, but I keep getting paranoid thoughts about losing everything
0/1	I mean it was never much of a negotiation. More like the EU telling the UK what was acceptable.
1/-1	I mean people are allowed to choose sovereignty over a stronger economy, the economy is not the be all end all of life. I think there were just too many cultural clashes with the European and British identities that frayed the relationship over time. All we can aim for now is to rebuild as amicable relationship as possible after years of political contempt from both sides.
0/0	I mean...impede brexit fuck brexit kill it just no one gives a fuck it ruins people's lives fuck Theresa may actually no don't she's probably got teeth in there anyway JUST GET IT OVER WITH OR DON'T GET ON WITH IT AT ALL!!!!!! FUCKING ISRAEL WILL BE BETTER THAN THE UK
0/0	I met a lad at the pub hosting 'Brexit Night' celebrations who said he knew little about the EU, 'didn't really do politics', and admitted that he was only there for the free curry. I told him "well then, you'll be glad to know that you won't now be called up for the EU army." He looked a bit stunned.
0/0	I might not be there but I feel the pain they are suffering and are going to suffer.
0/0	I might see it wrong because i belave it to be extreamly stupid for england to leave. Tell me what from the EU affects any of you the english people personly in a bad way? I only see the media and the numbers of economy data but not the people so tell me pls.
0/0	I miss the good old days when Brexit wasn't part of our vocabulary. It never should of happened.
1/0	I moved to Finland I have a job here also I moved to Greece and Portugal and had full time employment there too.. I am from Wales I've done pretty alright with free movement 🇪🇺
1/1	I must admit, I have been pretending to be against Brexit for a while now because of pier pressure, it’s good to see that other people have spoken there minds 😄
1/1	I must assume that you came to this country because there is something about Britain that appealed to you. You came here, want to settle, and be British. Which means you have some stake in the future of Britain, right? The elephant in the room in the brexit debate is immigration, and we're not talking about high skilled, educated, legal immigrants like yourself. We're talking about the other immigrants. The unskilled, illiterate, and ultra-religious. These people are going to destroy British culture. They come here and do not integrate. Indeed they cannot these people are illiterate in their native language, speak no English (and no intention of learning), cannot get a job here, and come from a culture that is antithetical to our own, and (given our birth rates vs theirs) in 20 years there will be more of them than there is of us. This country that you've chosen as your home will not be here in 20-30 years if this continues.
0/0	I never consented to have my EU citizenship removed against my will.
1/1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday. A no deal is even better! Get us out! teresa May is traitor these politicians are traitors, and they should be trialled for treason. People said Out!! Out!! We want Out!
0/0	I never thought Brits could be so crass.
0/0	I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government.
1/1	I never voted for any deals... I voted to All out LEAVE the EU and Single Market Bloc!!!
1/0	I never voted out for this shit deal now let's have a revolution
0/0	I never wanted it. I voted remain.
1/1	I never, ever,ever go on holiday to Europe. I would rather eat my own p o o !
1/1	I now see Brexit as the last great opportunity to kickstart the European project over again
0/0/0	I now strongly support and will democratically fight for a re-entry to the EU, even without all the special arrangements, which the UK enjoyed
0/0	I often travel into the EU to play live music. That's my career fucked then.
0/0	I over heard my manager who has 5 kids and earns £8.50 an hour say she is gunna vote boris because she doesnt want to have to pay tax for immigrants, its at that moment i gave up on democracy.
0/1	I personally believe that all the Brexit shebang was organised by remainers in the EU to better integrate UK into EU structures. Letting Britain to crash out of the EU, suffer serious economical consequences so they would crawl back begging to accept them back to the Union, but only this time they will have to integrate fully - adopt Euro currency, enter Schengen zone, lose all the Opt-outs and Vetos they currently have. It's an EU master plan and only blind can not see it. (slow clap 👏)
0/0	I personally didn't vote to leave I voted to stay the concequences and repercussions we will have from leaving the eu will continue to grow and halter our economy.
0/0/0	I personally don't think it was a good idea at any point.
0/0	I personally feel very worried for the future. The value of the GBP is still 20% less than what it was and seems to still be dropping. I'm also annoyed that 16-17 year olds were not given a vote (They were given a vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum, but not in the EU Referendum). I'm disappointed that people decided not to listen to experts on the subject, instead tuning out the academics in favour of the Daily Express. I'm disgusted by the increased number of hate-crimes against minorities committed by people who feel that such behaviour is acceptable, and I feel uneasy about the future. I feel just as nervous about it now as I did on June 24th when the results came in. All I can say is, thank god for dual citizenship,
1/-1	I personally find it unfair that law-abiding non-EU citizens who pay their dues in the UK have to face a disproportionate number of hoops to jump through in order to seek a future in the UK after graduating from university
0/0/0	I personally think Brexit is just a pep talk that will never happen and that should not happen for the lives of 500 million people.We should be the ones to make changes not the MP, us, we need to make the world a better place,a safer place!
0/0	I personally think it was a huge mistake and a bad thing for the UK and EU. Secretly, it makes me laugh and I'm very entertained watching the "enlightened" Europeans experiencing the very things they often lecture others about. Hard to criticize others when your union is starting to literally fall apart from the inside out. How could that possibly be?
1/1	I personally voted to leave because as a teenager at school when we voted to enter EEC i was taught how great free trade would be.At the time no one was aware of the loss of power,laws and stupid EU laws and more important no vote on the leadership of the EU.If you don't like how your country is ruled you vote in another party,that doesn't work in the EU.To me it was not about immigration it was the fact we where not told how the EU would develope. May be the older generation felt hoodwinked in the past.I like the idea of the EU but not the way it is turning out.
0/1	I personally voted to leave, along with a number of my friends from university and college. We did so on the basis of economics, aware of the fact that leaving would result in several years of a reduced economy, but firmly believing that our government would be capable of negotiating more prosperous trade deals outside of the EU, while also maintaining the freedom of movement for EU member countries and the UK to maintain a positive relation with the EU. This would also encourage more economic migrants to enter the UK due to improved trade opportunities, etc. However, what we ended up with was being lumped in with a load of ill-informed racists, a load of Tory sensationalism, and frankly, one of the most pathetic first-world Governments I've ever laid my eyes on. At the time, I believed that David Cameron could suck up his pride and help negotiate a prosperous deal for all involved (albeit at a short term negative outcome for the UK - that was always a given with the Leave vote and I was prepared for that), but instead he dropped out, fucked off, gave us Theresa May and essentially said "well I know I said I'd stick by what the people wanted, but what I really meant was 'I'm a Tory and you should have known better'". Anyway, suffice to say I now regret my vote. But hey, hindsight is 20-20.
0/-1/-1	I phoned ITN newsdesk, about a segment a reporter did on Dutch fishermen livelihoods being affected by Brexit
0/0	I plan to ignore the news today, I'm far too upset about leaving the EU. Part of me remains European
1/1	I pray Brexit will deal a huge blow to the EU and to all the globalists who own it! May God bless Mr Boris and Mr Nigel....for turning Britain away from the jaws of EU..
0/0	I pray for a second referendum. I prayU.K. will remain in the European union
1/1	I pray that the brexit will be successful one day.
0/0	I pray to God we the United Kingdom remains within the European Union!!!! because the UK is much stronger inside the EU. Remaining in the EU opens up more doors towards prosperity for us. PLEASE VOTE REMAIN ON 23RD JUNE
1/1	I pray we are OUT..Give my grandchildren HOPE!! GOOD LUCK BREXIT!!
1/1	I prayed for this day
0/0	I predict that the only thing in defence of a no-deal Brexit is just that it will show every nationalist idiot what Brexit truly means
0/-1	I prefer not , but in any case it is not important for economics. British will always intend to unite economics with USA , rather than with EU. It is enough if they stay in NATO together with EU and USA.
0/0	I prefer to stay in the EU
0/0	I promise to vote stay this time.
1/1	I raise my glass brilliant... lets put the "Great" back into Britain onward and forward.. from now on..
0	I read a transcript of this. I was embarrassed for him.
0/0	I read somewhere "Brexit will go down in history as the worst case example of direct democracy"
0/0	I realise that but Brexit will be far worse.
0/0	I really can’t see how the UK is going to survive this intact. The divisions are growing all the time. All BJ’s talk of healing is just posturing, playing to the crowd. How long can he realistically deny the Scottish government a referendum after what’s happened with Brexit. He’s more unpopular there than Thatcher was. I don’t think the Irish trust him one bit. The way he’s ‘moving us forward’ is never going to work long term.
1/1	I really hate the eu
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU.
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything.
1/1	I really have concern about the mental health and thinking ability of remoaners. It’s like they are in a brain washed cult.
1/1	I really hope people come to their senses and vote to leave. The EU is a straight jacket that is taking the very life-blood out of the nation states. It is an empire doomed to failure as it is built on idealism in that all member nations can be squeezed into the same mold, whereas nations need realism and the freedom to develop. All the UK really needs is being part of a free trade zone, nothing else as we can sort out all our own problems.
0/0/0	I really hope the French are utterly merciless and make the Brits pay dearly out of the nose. Like fifty percent tariffs.
0/0	I really hope the Queen steps in and fixes this. I know she does not want to do things like that, but she almost has to.
0/0	I really hope they go downhill now
0/0	I really really really hope we stay
0/0	I really really wish we did not leave the EU. I would not be at all surprised if many people emigrated from the UK. This country's finished. People in this country are so selfish.
0/0	I really think this European Union project is the greatest achievement for all people on this continent
0/0/0	I really would like some politicians to be honest enough to say “Yes, Brexit is really, really shitty, and we’re all going to suffer from it, but hey, you voted for it, so we’ll do it anyway.”
1/1	I really would like to see a no deal Brexit. Just to learn who was right. I really foresee UK economy getting crushed, but lets just wait and see and get ourselves some popcorn. Greetings from Europe.
0/0	I realy wish that the EU would work, we need unity in Europe so that we can remain a powerful nation amongst China and the US
0/0	I refuse to be discouraged. We can still stop Brexit. Let us have a second referendum. I know it is dangerous - but at least we will have tried to save our country from a deep and prolonged recession
0/0	I remain unconvinced that a significant proportion of Leave voters will be happy with the eventual outcome.
0/0	I remember feeling shocked when I found out the result of the referendum. I didn't expect it at all. "Why would you want to leave the EU? That's just a plain stupid thing to do. So arrogant to think you would be better off alone" I thought.
1/1/0	I remember the 1997 general election as it was the first I could vote in. UKIP were a tiny fringe party. From that to Brexit in 20 years is astonishing.
0	I reminded DUP that Brexit isn't cause for celebration,but means negative economic impacts
0/0	I respect everyone’s opinion but I think we should stay! The people’s vote has been decided even if it was based on lies.
0/0	I run an aircraft repair company. So I'm pissed off as I've had to move my base ops along with my family from UK to EU as the threat of restrictions on work, travel import, exports & visas as there's already people being given short Visa stays even though they've been in the UK paying well above average taxes for over 15yrs. So to all my Staff they feel uncertain as if there's any friction it'll cost money which equals jobs. Equally now I'm on the continent it's far easy to get around and now and have clients in countries that were put off before from the high pound value.
1/1	I saw a video on facebook where an official guy claimed that leaving the EU meant leaving Europe altogether, which is BS. I saw another where an official warned that if we leave, the prices of all goods will go up, especially ice cream.
1/1	I say Hard Brexit is the best. The EU is falling apart and never had the self interest of any of the members in mind to begin with.
0/0	I say again: Why aren't the media hounding BoJo to #ReleaseRussiaReport ? #RejoinEU #DitchJohnson #Brexit
0/0/0/0/0/0	I say give us a second referendum. Give us a chance to stop this nonsense.
1/1	I say leave and get it over with. The majority (no matter how slim) voted to leave. So leave. Put on your boots and walk out. It's your country at stake you should worry about, not the rest of Europe.
0/0	I say no to brexit. Are you listening Theresa?
1/1	I say they should leave. The attitude of UK has always been of wanting the economic benefits with none of the responsibilities.
0/-1	I say we don't stop at the EU. Let's get the British to leave the planet. They can be the first Mars colony which is good because they are used to bad weather and food.
1/1/0	I secretly hope the leave campaign wins because it will expedite the break up of the Union.
0/0	I see British people as civilized and knowledgeable people, but how can they follow the mind of mentally disabled person like Boris Johnson?
0/0	I see a bright future for GB... in the gutter!
0/1	I see a lot of Leavers online threatening civil unrest if we remain, but now also threatening civil unrest if we leave with a deal... If they start shouting that a bit louder would that not in itself be a good case to remain?
1/1	I see the EU is getting desperate, look anyone with half a brain knows Brexit is the best thing to happen to the UK, lies and misinformation will not change that
1/1	I see the ilk of those who encouage EU membership, and know,out is the enlightened choice.
1/1	I see the ‘planes are still flying. Local supermarket still full of food. Restaurants in post-Brexit London still packed on a Saturday night. Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
1/1	I seem to recall a certain little corporal, who had also over-run Europe, threatening us in 1939. Our response was two fingers. The same again is indicated now.  The Eurocrats are being sore losers, financially and emotionally, they are trying to control us - yet again - because they fear Great Britain succeeding, which it will, without their control and over-lordship. Where Britain leads - others will follow. Brexit lunch happening in Australia for us-expats at an English pub with proper English bitters. We shall be toasting our Independence Day. God Save The Queen, for nothing can save the EU!
0/0	I sense the column of ones that benefit is rather more limited in scope to the column for ones that won't: "There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won't," he told the paper.
0/0	I seriously hope the UK does NOT LEAVE THE EU :( The fact that we're even having a vote makes me sad!
0/0	I seriously think, brexiters may have some sort a brain damage from social media or smth to want such a thing.
1/1/1	I shall be celebrating at 11pm. Bottle of English sparkling wine on chill already. I'm not young but, for the first time in my life, at 11pm tonight I will live in an independent, sovereign nation. So excited about it!
1/1	I shall ease off my following of these comments forums as now Britain is legally out, the remaintards (now I know what that word means) will soon be the only ones left. The rest of us are focusing on the future.
1/0	I shall never forgive any of the major Remainers.
0/0/0	I shouldn’t laugh at our own misfortune, it will do neither myself or my own any good. I am so angry
0/0	I sincerely hope EU workers in England and Wales will move to Scotland and help us in our bid for Independence from Westminster to secure our place in Europe.
0/0	I sincerely hope that the UK will STAY in the EU in the future. As a european citizen I really believe we in the united EU countries make a stronger argument for trade and macro economics with the world like the united states of america. Together we ARE stronger.
0/0	I smell war in a few years from now
1/1	I spent a decade living in the remnants of the CCCP, the greatest failure in social engineering in history. I know exactly why I wanted a Brexit. The removal of a centralised, behemoth of a self serving bureacracy.
0/0/0/0	I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say "bye" to a nationalist England!
1/1	I still believe brexit was the right choice, it's just I have no confidence of it ever being delivered. Nobody I know voted for more free trade and more immigration but that's what we're getting.
1/1	I still believe it will be the best for the country in the long run. It's also interesting to see how the lies on both sides of the campaign are coming to light.
0/0	I still can't believe how people voted to get out of the EU. Why you can't give a chance to the immigrants? Fucking dickheads #brexit
0/0	I still can't take Brexit seriously. It's too stupid.
1/0	I still don't enjoy the idea of the european union and I particularly don't enjoy the was that it operates
0/-1	I still don't know shit about this issue. I get that the UK wants to be more independent, but wasn't the whole point of the EU supposed to be to enable Europe to compete with the United States' massive economy
1/1/1/1	I still don't regret voting to leave the European Union. Every time I see a politician whining, or trying to undo the vote it makes me even prouder to have voted Leave.
0/0	I still don't understand what the Brexiters think they've 'won'. We lose our EU travel and voting rights, we lose access to EU medical care and we lose access to one of the biggest trading blocks in the world. Ordinary folk lose 'freedoms' and gain nothing. Brexit is a massive confidence trick played by the rich for their own benefit and it will be up to the next generation to clean up the mess!
0	I still don't understand why people thought it was a good idea. It really does seem like those that voted had no idea what the EU does and what they were voting for.
0/0	I still don't understand why the UK want's to leave the EU.
0	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame
0/0	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame. They'll just divert it elsewhere. And the average people on the streets are the ones that will suffer.
0/0	I still suspect Brexit's going to be called off!
0/0	I still think it'll all end in tears.
1/1	I still want Full Fat Brexit !!!
1/1	I still want out!
1/1	I strongly believe EU will have a great future! The presence of the British with their selfishness and self-centeredness made the union weak and ineffective. Finally they are out!
1/1	I strongly feel it would be a mistake to remain in the EU which is part of the Globalist architecture which will do nothing good for the working man in the UK.
1/1/1	I suggest all remoaners go and live in Belgium .
1/1	I support Boris 100%
1/1/1/1/1/1	I support Brexit )
1/1	I support Brexit and the UK can save high dues to the EU.
1/1	I support Brexit because that is what they voted for. Will of the people.
1/1	I support Brexit. Cannot happen soon enough
1/1	I support brexit and why most people I know support brexit
1/1	I support brexit because article 13 passed and I want my British memes
1/1	I support brexit because it means indepdnece for Britain.
1/1	I support the UK, I'll be rooting for them to succeed no matter where they go. On the flip side the rest of Europe is somewhat annoying and I just don't care what happens to the rest of the EU
1/1	I supported Brexit and I support Scotish independence. Basically, I love the idea of secession. It should be done more often. I hope I live to see Hong Kong secede from China. I hope we see a US state (or three) successfully secede as well. These massive centralized world governments need to be broken up sooner, before we're all living under some tyrannical global dystopia.
1/1	I suppose I should say that the politicians that pushed for no brexit should be put in jail, but I believe in democracy - you don't seem to understand the concept, you talk like a nazi.
1/1	I suppose a big part that voted for leave voted because of uncontrollable immigration from 3rd world countries at the time. Even political campaign was all about this at the time and not about economy.
1/0/0	I suppose it sets a bad example as now other nations may leave which would weaken the EU. Then again UK never used the Euro and seems to go there own way regarding electrical outlets and which side of the road to drive on. Due to this nonconformity I suppose if any nation would leave it would be the one with the independent streak
1/1	I suppose that the good news is that NO older remain voters are dying off. Consequently the Remoaner vote will be in the majority. Yeah! Dream on. We’re leaving. Get over it. You pro EU lot are all the same. If you don’t like the result, keep voting until you get the result you want. It’s happening in Italy. The EU wanted to insert a pro EU Finance Minister but the Italians won’t have it. Now, another election. But this time the Italians will vote the same way as they have had enough of your beloved EU.
0/0	I suppose the Brexit is to become indepent? So they gonna grow all the crops their selfs? What happens when Corona virus strikes there? Or do they somehow conjure a vaccine out of nowhere?
0/0	I sure hope I am still alive to see Scotland and NI, as members of the EU but free from the current UK union, vote to block the prospects of a return to the EU by little Brexitland. Even if just for a little while for jokesies/revenge You may have shafted us with this ridiculous Brexit but we will have the last laugh
0/0	I suspect cabinet ministers have to take an LQ test to see who are the best liars before they're allowed on TV. #BorisJohnson would no doubt top the poll. He's a Mensa level liar!
1/1	I suspect it is not only the Brits who will soon be demanding the freedom to opt out.
0/0	I suspect most of them don't really care what happens next and they are entirely unaccountable for their actions.
0/0	I think #brexit and #VoteLeave is a mistake. We should stay in the #eu and reform. Calm heads needed #eureferendum
1/1	I think Brexit is a chance for the UK. And you should proceed to leave on the 29th March. I even think a No-Deal-Brexit wouldn't be such a bad thing.
0/0	I think Brexit is a disaster unfolding. Corporations control this world. It will get worse once we leave.
0/0	I think Brexit is a mistake
0/0	I think Brexit is an ill-informed decision that will damage the country long-term.
0/0	I think Brexit is going to be the best example of why not to leave
1/1	I think Brexit is good but am swayed by the biscuits argument.
1/1	I think Brexit is good. We don't lose as much money. we can control over our laws, trade etc. Immigration control.
0/0	I think Brexit is overall a bad idea, and the way it has been handled has made the situation even worse. However, a second referendum would not be a good idea. They don't work. We just got fucked by one. We elect governments with the intention that they will work on our behalf to do the best for the country. Stop letting us role the dice when we don't know best and it's not our job.
0/0	I think Brexit is the most silly thing anyone could’ve voted for
1/1	I think De Gaulle was right when he did not allow Britain to be a member of the EEC.
1/1	I think England should just rip the band-aid off and leave. It's a good move for them.
1/-1	I think England will not , but definitely The north of Ireland and Scotland Will, some rumbling in Wales also , but that could be just them singing,!?
0/0	I think I will move to Scotland and re-join EU. Let’s all do that!
0/0/1	I think Leavelings need an 'Aginy Ant', someone like #Brexit Brenda. Dear Brenda, I was exactic on Friday night, we finally got are sovrinty back. But on Saturday, I went shopping with the Missus & there were still all these forrins around. Boris said he'd got Brexit done, WTF?
0/1	I think No Deal is better than a bad deal. May must go and a true Brexiteer Patriot should replace her as PM. I will never, ever vote Conservative again if Brexit is Brexit in name only and I'm not the only one. There will be blood on the streets if government doesn't get us out free and clear of the EU. Just look at us now pleading to leave like prisoners just think how bad it would get if we remained and don't forget we would have to accept the euro, all of Europe's migrants and debts and all of their rules too. No, we want to be free of the evil EU chains that bind us and as English men it is our sovereign and legal rite to be freemen. Those who try to take or give away our sovereignty and freedom whether in government or not are traitors and should be treated as such.
1/1	I think UK did a good job concerning Europe. Brexit was exactly the kick in the butt the EU needed. I hope the bureaucrats finally understood how dire the situation is, and that UK one day may join in again, when the EU has become a democratic institution.
1/-1	I think a lot of people disliked about membership of the EU is the constant (mostly gradual, sometimes not) extension of its scope, with no limit to the gradual transfer of power ("competence").
0/0	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far
0/0	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far.
1/1	I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.
1/1	I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.  Perhaps what they mean is that I was never exposed to the brainwashing propaganda such as the "Erasmus" programme and the pro eu propaganda blatantly practiced in modern UK universities.  Perhaps I have had time to watch the eu grow from a simple trading partnership into a political entity intent on creating a European state.  Perhaps I read a lot of books written from pro,neutral and anti eu standpoints.  Perhaps it is because I visited Brussels and watched and listened to the lobbyists in the bars and coffeshops.  Perhaps it is because my work means rubbing shoulders with many Europeans on their home turf.  Perhaps it is because I listened to them.  So yes,I am undereducated in that I have not studied a non subject like modern European art forms in a university in the last twenty years.  I should count myself lucky,and I do!
0/0	I think even the most ardent of Brexit voters would agree that whatever deal happens, the UK will face interim economic damage.
0/0	I think everybody should have known what they were voting for, so after making your bed, it is time to sleep in it.
0/0	I think getting leaving the EU is a bad idea. It also means less control, not more. All this is without mentioning the havoc that would ensue if, as the prime minister has threatened, we crash out of the EU without a deal as the prime minister has threatened.
1/-1	I think if the majority voted for it then they must’ve had a reason. I wish them the best in whatever comes next.
0/0	I think in the long run the UK will regret this decision, hopefully not tho.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire. The UK, strong, can rival anyone in the world by itself, so why would it surrender its sovereignty? Except that it's not the case anymore, as the great European nations of the 19th century (UK, France, Germany...) fell behind the behemoths that are China, the US... Unified, however, the EU is clearly top 3 in all matters, and best in some. Also, I am quite disgusted by the ton of disinformation we have seen during the campaign. UKIP is by no means better than Trump and is largely to blame for this folly.
1/1	I think it is good the UK leaves as they were never that happy to be in the EU.
1/1/1	I think it is great that Britain is following democracy and will be free. As a NZer I feel we are much closer culturally and historically to Australia, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, PNG etc. than Britain is to many European countries, but I'd hate the thought of being joined politically. Freedom is more important than wealth.
1/1	I think it should be fine. I’m leaning pro-brexit, but honestly they should just stop delaying shit.
1/1	I think it should be recognized that Brexit was an amazing victory against massive odds by the ordinary people of the UK. Remember during the run up to the election the amount of Lovies and leaders who spoke for Remain. The whole of the British Liberal Elite, President of the USA, the Pope, the BBC, just about every actor and celebrity, and many many more. There followed three years of Brexiteers accused of not knowing what we voted for, brexiteers overnight became Bigoted fascist racist Little Englanders who had stolen their children's future and destroyed the Union. I feel so proud that we were so instrumental in defending democracy and becoming a Sovereign Nation again. Congratulations to all Brexiters.
0/0	I think it was a poorly planned out plan that will harm England‘s foreign relations.
0/0	I think it will blow up in people’s faces, and I think that’s what it’s going to take to show people that the UK isn’t the “powerhouse” it was in the past, people need to be humbled..Brexit blowing up might just help with that.
1/1	I think it will open many many doors. We can trade with whoever we want, however we want.
0/0	I think it would be interesting to give people a sheet of paper with policies on it and ask people whether they think it's UK government policy or EU policy. See if people can tell what the EU actually does or if they still believe the lies told by Politicians and rag newspapers
0/0	I think it's a mistake, esp economically
1/1	I think it's a positive process that's going to work out for the UK.
0/0/0/0	I think it's dumb.
0/0/0	I think it's going to be bad very bad no one know what will happen
0/1	I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. Scotland is likely going to leave, the Troubles are going to rev up again, and the various unintended consequences are going to be felt for decades.
1/0	I think it's going very well. I've already noticed more police on the streets, & the 40 new hospitals they've built are great!
1/1/1/1	I think it's great that Britain left the EU because the EU just look out for their selves and their own country
0/0	I think it's only a matter of time before the best vote with their feet and move - to where I'm not sure given that the idiots have removed our freedom of movement. Tragic times ahead.
0/0/0	I think it's stupid. It's a huge mistake. Both the UK and the EU are better off with each other than without
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I think it's the best decisions Britain has made in a long time
1/1/1/1	I think it's time for the UK to prioritise it's citizens. What is the use of having your own Parliament if the EU will not respect or honour your country's law?
0/1/1	I think its time for the UK to go down this path and ultimately discover what a single nation can do in a global economy dominated by three huge trading blocs.
1/1	I think it’s a great move, to be in control of your own country.
0/0	I think it’s a terrible idea. Especially if it’s hard Brexit, from what I know it’s practically guaranteed to destroy the economy. It seems to be founded on a form of ultranationalism that attempts to justify that it’s okay to destroy your country in order to reject cultural pluralism.
1/-1	I think it’s an opportunity to weaken the real enemy here, Europe. Without Britain, the E.U. is merely a confederation of Germany, France, and everyone else — and history has shown how beautifully Germany and France work together. Britain will be weakened post-Brexit, but its military is still formidable and the country is a regional superpower — a worthy ally of the U.S. I think President Trump sees the value in our special relationship as long as the U.K. has something to offer us. I’m trying to figure out what that might be.
1/1	I think it’s going to be a success and glad we are leaving
0/0	I think it’s the worst thing that will ever happen to this country. I think it’s absolutely disastrous,
1/1	I think life will go on pretty much as before but with extra expense and hassle!
0/0	I think most of ppl in UK (not Scotish,i have to say that) are stupid (mostly old persons) because they dont understand what EU really is.It's easier way to transport goods,money,people and stop at this point because PEOPLE means a lot in UK,i mean they hate non-native persons like polish people (18 children in 18-20 age attacked adult 2 polish persons who talks to each other in polish and they was beated by them,was is dead and 1 is hospital,thank you so much for beeing tolerant :D).UK community doesnt understand that refugees will be always,that doesnt mean "if UK leaves EU we wont have refugees :D",IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT.I am done with people like them.Older people who are untolerant and dont understand what they did to whole Europe and their economy.
0/0	I think most of us in Europe are hoping for a no-Brexit scenario.
0/0	I think my dad is one of few older people I've spoken to that doesn't want to leave the EU. I'm proud.
0/0	I think our own policies are far more damaging. Self imposed austerity. A government that only responds to one demographic. The eu was keeping those cunts in parliament in check. But I guess you're fine with having corporations fucking us over (and the richest of them already do, cos our government is as limp as a geriatric when it comes to tax from the big boys) . The supposed cut in red tape will be more, again benefiting the big multinationals rather than small independents. Prices are soaring. And yet our government still had its finger up its own arse. There are simple answers - scrap brexit, because it was an ill informed shit show of a referendum. But I guess you want less accountability and more power for an increasingly authoritarian government. Globalisation is here to stay. Brexit is not going to stop that. I would even argue that with a weakened government the big corps will be able to dictate even more. But that's OK for you as long as there is less Europeans on the street, serving you coffee, picking the harvest and generally contributing to society, while the majority of these half brained brits complain that washing dishes is beneath them. Fuck all of you brexiteer cunts to death, fuck you
1	I think our stance on Brexit has perhaps been one of the most powerful things in helping people to recognise the values of the Liberal Democrats.
1/1	I think people are starting to forget that that tiny island controlled almost all of the world at one point in history,leaving the failing EU will be seen as the greatest moments in British 21st century history.
1/0	I think people are yearning . . . for this great Incubus [Brexit] to be pitchforked off the back of British politics. They want us to get on with some fantastic things for this country.
1/1	I think people of Europe should try their best to fix the EU before dismantling it, there are too many dangers for Europe if EU gets destroyed - large countries being able to easily bully us being one of them. UK should be allowed to fully leave though, they voted for it and it should be honored
1/1	I think some of the Brexit people remember why we joined the EU in the first place. It was only for trade. Once we were in it started to turn political. This is not what we initially voted for. Pretend you are out of the EU now with free global trade (Europe included), we controll all our own laws and borders. Would you vote to join, knowing what you were going to give up control of? I certainly would not. Immigration is a MASSIVE issue. Actually what I am against is UNCONTROLLED immigration. This in itself causes some peoples blood to boil. And remember, there are ~50 countries in Europe, 28 of which are in the EU. All these countries trade with the EU just fine.
0/-1	I think that 70 years of peace in Europe, led to loss of memory - The E.U. it's not ONLY economy....
0/0/0	I think that Boris Johnson is an imbecile, that Theresa May should have held a second referendum, that Article 50 should have stipulations added for requiring two public votes for exit to occur, and that Great Britain is looking like it's about to just be 'Britain' once again. Given how close the Scottish Independence vote was, back when Brexit was just an idea, I'm not surprised in the slightest that they've decided to hold a referendum once again, for the sake of remaining in the EU. One thing I seriously believe might be the only good solution for NI right now is for them to vote for their independence from the UK, however they should remain their own nation inside of the EU, free to make trade deals with England as they see fit. It'd be too much to ask them to formally be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland like Sinn Féin has been pushing for decades. That's what I think is the only fair compromise that doesn't outright break the Good Friday agreement. Though the good Friday agreement doesn't specifically allow for NI to vote for complete independence of both parties, I would interpret a majority vote to leave the UK, and a vote to not unify would be valid under the agreement, I don't know too much about how strict or loose an interpretation of an agreement that old is allowed to be, so please correct me if I'm wrong about my interpretation.
0/0	I think that Brexit is bad for the UK because if the UK left the customs union and the single market the British economy would be damaged significantly
0/0	I think that Brexit is leading to impaired governance, social anxiety and squeezed living standards.
0/0	I think that Brexit is not good for both the Britain and EU.
1/1	I think that EU should not be all about Economy. The main problem with actual EU is that is an economic Giant and a political Dorf. It is very significative that precisely Great Britain, one of the first promotors of the idea of an Unified Europe, becames the first to leave the group. On the other side, I think Great Britain will continue to assume a preponderant role in World Econmy. Sorry, I havent been objective in the answer, but I think the main problem with EU is that economic issues always came first relatively to other signicant ones. I coul not help it!
0/0	I think that brexiteers are wrong in what's going to happen.
1	I think that's one reason why people who have personally watched it change from the EEC into what it is now are more likely to be leave voters.
1/1	I think that, all considered, Brexit will be good for the EU.
1/1	I think the British are so wise they leave while they still can.
1/0/0	I think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything
0/0/0/0/0	I think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything.
0/0	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for.
0/0	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for. A lot of people don't even realise the meaning of brexit sadly yet it's such an important decision that will impact the future generations.
1/0	I think the EU is great. Yes, it does have problems, but which country doesn't? If we stay united we will find the solutions.
1/1	I think the EU is structurally and economically unsound, utterly and completely resistant to change, lacking in transparency, possibly even corrupt, and ultimately will collapse.
0/0	I think the EU is worth it but needs a lot of work
1/1	I think the EU oversteps it's bounds a lot. The benefits of membership are pretty fixed, but the drawbacks ratchet up year by year.
0/0	I think the UK is shooting itself in the face.
0/1	I think the best approach is to get over it and wait to see what happens. "I told you so" is about the only thing anyone who wanted to remain in the EU has left.
0/0	I think the clusterfuck of the last 3-4 years is proof enough why they *shouldn't* be independent. But they made their made, time to sleep in it. And honestly, the Brits have been getting a little fucking uppity lately, so perhaps a nice humbling embarrassing experience is exactly what they need. In the end, I hope they come out OK. But I know in the interim they're in for a shitshow, and they have nobody to blame for that but themselves.
1/1/1	I think the debate is over and Brexit done. We were sold that we could develop better overall trading structure without contributions and reduce immigration without harming economy and could break business free from unnecessary regulation. Tories have huge majority so no excuses not to deliver.
1/1	I think the decision will be made around July. I don't think it will go the distance if the EU continue to act as children. Too many jobs are dependent on the EU member state's biggest single market - the UK. The 27 will be experiencing a lot of pressure from their businesses to get a deal done.
0/0/0/0	I think the first thing we'll see after Brexit is the exodus of young and bright talent from London to major European cities like Paris, Amsterdam or Berlin.
1/1	I think the idea is that we will have to conform to less EU laws
1/1	I think the majority of Brits care and will vote to leave they are seeing through the rhetoric.
1/1	I think the point about this referendum that terrifies a lot of people is that it is the Elite (in) vs the people (out). The Elite controls the political agenda which creates a lot of frustration for lesser mortals who can't find a voice.
0/-1	I think the protest is logical and your( i assume your from there) president is stupid
1/1	I think the remainers, and EU lovers just using scare tactics. I have full faith in Brexit and we all need to unite as one and build a better future for are country.
1/1	I think the sooner we are out of the EU the better.
0/0	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer.
0/0	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer. The people that are still shocked we would do something as stupid as leave the EU have become the dominant voice... Well outside of the news entertainment channels.
1/0/1	I think they way that the EU is structured, with, I have no doubt, high corruption swept under the carpet, then they are incapable of negotiating in good faith. Too many special ' favours' to look after.
0/0	I think this is the biggest blunder in UK’s history for a very, very long time.
1/1	I think this seems totally like a good idea. After Brexit we’ll have taken back control of our waters and stuff.
1/1/1	I think this sums up just how out of touch the liberal left are with real people, the sooner we are out the better.
1/1	I think we can learn a lot from the Brexit by watching it unfold. If it is a positive effect for their country, I believe the US should follow them by leaving the Chinese union.
0/-1	I think we can't just take the estimate to calculate the opportunity cost of Brexit. We would need to compare how other countries in the EU, with similar estimates have done.
0/0	I think we have embarrassed ourselves and that whatever the outcome, this country is going to be a less pleasant one.
0/0/0	I think we knew from day one that brexit is all about blaming immigrants for everything. Tragic nonsense - if you want to blame anybody for the deficiencies in your life you should start with the tories, thatcher and neoliberalism.
1/1	I think we will hugely thrive outside the EU. it will be a painfull adjustment but one worth taking
0/0	I think we will regret leaving the EU, good on Scotland for keeping the EU flag flying. You go go for independence, good luck to you as a country with foresight and common sense,
1/1	I think weve subsidised the poorer countries of the EU for long enough. Time to put our own people first!
0/0	I think we’ll live to regret it in a few years’ time. They’re (the EU is) our closest neighbors so we want to get closer to them, not further away from them, it’s just common sense,
1/-1	I think you'll find we did address whether there is a real movement for leaving the EU on 23rd June
0/-1	I though it was dumb at first (or at least too soon to do it), but after having voted yes, they should have just left instead of keeping it in a state of brextension. The longer they kept it up, the less negotiating power they have.
0/0	I though that #Brexit was going to mean more control of borders. Now it turns out that #Brexit will be less control of our borders and a security risk. #PeoplesVote
0	I thought Boris "dead in a ditch but rose from the dead" is the Superhero. Enlight me.
0/0	I thought about 'giving up'. The battle is still very much on. Bozo is looking like trying to deliver some abomination of brexit that nobody voted for. I think we're going to need protests.
1/1	I thought it was going to boost support for independence in Scotland, but the polls haven't really shown that, which is disheartening. Maybe the exit will have to actually go through first. As it happens I'm going to be studying abroad at Edinburgh next semester, so I'll be right in the thick of it.
0/0	I thought that the EU was reformable, UK sovereignty unimportant, and that I would be better off in.
0/0/0	I thought the leavers thought it undemocratic to keep voting on something until you get the result you want? Odd.
1/1	I tormented myself over whether voting for Brexit was the right thing to do. I have grandchildren. Now, more than ever, I would vote Leave. To remain scares me almost as much as Jeremy Corbyn!
0/0	I totally agree with all the points made in the article, but Simon Jenkins ultimately falls into the trap of referring to this as a 'divorce'. I've never seen a couple where one member is six times bigger than the other. As his own arguments make clear, it's just ridiculous to claim that this is a relationship between equals. But the Brexit propaganda seems to be doing a good job (again) in spreading this lie.
1/1	I totally agree with the comments made by the PM and fully support his stance. The EU must never ever be able to rule the UK again whatever the cost. UK will not be over-ruled by this bunch. You want a fight then you can have it. Be carefull what you wish for.
0/1	I totally agree with you - Peace iin Europe is the greatest & most important achievement of the EU and the overriding reason for the EU. The UK is reckless to weaken this amazing project
0/0	I truelly believe that EU can do things that Nato cannot. #NoBrexit
1/1	I truely wish to leave, preferably today!
0/0	I trust the EU, I do not trust Johnson!
0/0/0	I understand half of the voters opted for "leave" but almost half of them didn't. If Theresa May wants to talk about the "will of the people" and "doing it for the people" then how does she explain ignoring the many people in her country who are not happy with her approach? I cannot imagine what it feels like when the government pretends you don't even exist.
0/0	I understand patriotism and love for ones home, but the Brexit is bad for the EU but devastating for the UK. Citizens need to listen to professionals on this matter not their emotions.
0/0	I understand that people want change but reacting to fear by cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will only make it worse.
1/1	I understand the rationale for EU membership if you are one of the countries receiving charity, but it's a shame the French and Germans don't have the balls to stand up and insist on a referendum, polls have shown their ordinary hard working people would vote leave in bigger numbers that the UK
0/0	I understand what y'all are saying, but at the same time it's so handy to have the EU.. so easy to travel between the countries in it and i know so many people who managed to get european fonds for their business and ideas.. that's kinda hard to give up when you're already used to the bad parts and enjoing the good ones (that's why, i think, so many of us, europeans, see the EU as a great thing)
0/1	I understand why people felt the way they did, but it’s not helpful to anyone.
1/0	I understood the message from Boris! We Europeans are undesirable as long as we don't give UK power and money
1/0/0	I understood the message from Boris! We Europeans are undesirable as long as we don't give UK power and money!
1/1/1	I used to be against Brexit but now I'm for it.
1	I used to be pro Europe but Greece has caused me to rethink my position. Unrestrained German Mercantilism is not how the EU is supposed to operate - better to get out now before it disintegrates.
1/1	I used to be pro-EU, then I realised what a fool I had been.
0/0	I used to feel rage, but I just can't sustain it for three years and I've got other things to concentrate on, so now I feel resignation, exasperation, weariness.....You could call it Brexit Burnout, I guess.
1/1	I used to love Corsica and Italy,ruined by the EU.Salvini trying to keep Italy Italian.
0/0	I used to think that brexiters generally were despicable, semi-literate, socially dysfunctional xenophobes with no grasp of economic reality and with little understanding of the fundamentals of a parliamentary democracy. Now I just think they're just sad and delusional, and blissfully unaware of the tsunami of ordure coming their way.
1/1	I used to vote Labour, i will not vote for Labour they backed Remain I would rather vote UKIP as they backed Leave.
1/0	I used to work for the EU. Italy was one of the founder members, having joined on 1 January 1958. As of the year 2000, Italy had never once 'implemented' an EU Directive (the process by which member states convert the Directive into their local legal system).
1/1	I value my nations independence and achievements and believe this will be seriously and irrevocably crippled by becoming just another cog in another superpowers arsenal.
1/1	I value these opinions, but I still think if the cup of tea wants the tea bag to remain, it needs to let the tea bag call its own shots on matters like border security and immigration
0/1	I vote for civil war if the establishment screw us over
1/1	I vote out b/c I want England to be for the English, simple as that.
0/0	I vote remain.
0/0	I vote remain. When people have to pay huge fees for nannies, cleaners and builders they will realise how idiotic their vote to leave was. #lovecheapbritain
1/1	I voted Brexit because of O'Brien.
1/1	I voted Leave (and would do so again)
1/0/1/1	I voted Leave - and I was well informed. So if there was another referendum then I'd simply vote LEAVE again. The only thing which has changed for me over the past 2 years is I never realised how biased the politicians are, how one sided the media are and how deluded remoaners are.
1/1	I voted Leave Best decision I have ever made in my lifetime At 11pm we are OUT FREEDOM!
1/1	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man.
1/1	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man. The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
1/1	I voted Leave because I don't want to be part of the United States of America, any more than the United States of Europe.
1/1	I voted Leave but had to think long and hard about it, now, absolutely leave, 100%
0/0/0	I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.
0/1	I voted Leave for a variety of reasons. The biggest one e was the promise of extra funds for the NHS followed closely by the fact that I was on the way out of various YouTube conspiracy rabbit holes and I was still anti Big Government. A lot has changed since that vote and a lot of lies and false promises were dolled out to the Public. I definately fucked up in voting leave. This isn't a reason for voting again as the info to counteract my views was there, I just didn't look for it. But the sheer amount of lies told to us at the time by the Leave campaign should give us the right to vote again. What I have noticed is that a large number of people who say they would vote leave again are older people whose futures are relatively secure.
1	I voted Leave to restore our independence and freedom after 43 years of control
1/1	I voted Leave, I consider myself a centrist. Happy today
1/1	I voted Leave, and would do so again. I believe the UK is better off outside the political institution that is the EU. But better off has many meanings, for me its a mixture of political, social, and economic issues, whereas most these days seem to be solely fixed on the economic aspects.
1/1	I voted Leave. I don’t want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us. If you want further European cooperation then I’m open to it, but under British dominance and not German. Nothing the EU provides could not also happen without the EU and with simple agreements between nations. It is a trade protection bloc, nothing more.
1	I voted OUT of the EU. I would vote out AGAIN and AGAIN and again and again and again and again and again. No one ever asked me if I wanted to join the EU.
1/1	I voted OUT.
0/0/0/0	I voted Remain, not just for political reasons but because my mum’s moved to Spain and I want her to stay there.
0/0	I voted Tory all my life. I never will again. They will take us to destruction of the economy because of their own desires to lead their party. When this hurts the poorest and the economy is reduced I will not forgive them for hurting the poorest more even if the poorest may well have voted for it on a campaign of what i believe were lies and false promises.
0/0	I voted against brexit and haven't changed my views. I also to take into account that 17 million people voted for brexit. Changing the decision of a mojority of voters now would most likely only make matters among the British population, which is already in a bad way. Safe to say, no matter what happens, its going to be one hell of a shit show.
1/1	I voted brexit I don't want to be told what to do by another country I don't have a problem with foreigners coming into this country to work and let's face it they are keeping this country moving why you like it or not
1/1	I voted brexit and will NEVER EVER regret it. Brexit will give us back our right to rule our country the way WE see fit.
1/1	I voted brexit, because of the lies about funding for the NHS. I'm a mental health advocate, and everytime the NHS does budget cuts, they take it out of the mental health system
0/1/1	I voted brexit, because of the lies about funding for the NHS. I'm a mental health advocate, and everytime the NHS does budget cuts, they take it out of the mental health system. I really do believe the mental health system is one of the most flawed, frustrating and horrible things to have to deal with; and it's in dire need of changing drastically. My choice had nothing to do with immigration, it was purely to help the NHS. however, after finding out that that promise was utter bullshit I feel betrayed and seriously regret my decision. I wish I wasn't so ignorant at the time.
1/1	I voted for Brexit ... and you sound like a remoaner!
1/1	I voted for Brexit in 2016, and would vote for it again today, if ever they held a second referendum. If anything, the events that have unfurled since 2016 - the EU trying to "punish" Britain as an example to others, showing that the club they pretend is so wonderful is actually Hotel California - have confirmed my long held view that EU = totalitarianism soft. Go away, Mr. Macron, your people hate you.
0/0	I voted for Brexit – and now I realise what a terrible mistake I made
1/1	I voted for Brexit, and did so with the expectation that there would be a short-term economic downturn as a result. Why would I do such a thing? Perhaps because I weighed up the options and realised that the best plan in the long-term would be to leave. Are you aware of any of the democratic and economic issues that leave voters voted on?
1/1	I voted for Brexit, as did most people I know. Would you like to know some legitimate reasons why people votes for Brexit? 17.4 million people voted, it isn't because we're all stupid or want to harm ourselves.
1/1	I voted for Brexit, but I have no qualms with a powerful, federal EU. I'd much rather they be the most powerful economy in the world than China, or India.
1/1	I voted for Brexit. I'm not die hard passionate about it. However I am very anti globalist so I am pleased to decentralise unelected power.
1/1	I voted for Brexit. What it is with me, I’d rather be a poor master than a rich servant. “It wasn’t about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.
1/1/1	I voted for a NO DEAL BREXIT.............. Did YOU?
1/1/1	I voted for a fair immigration policy. My wife is a non-EU citizen from Thailand and we are discriminated against. If I didn’t earn £20,000 or more – the required figure – the choice would be to claim benefits and then when it came to my wife’s visa renewal she would have to leave. Her visa costs almost £1,500 every every two-and-a-half years. Cameron has only himself to blame. He thought he could bully the electorate, the same as in the Scotland referendum, but forgot that nobody is enthused or patriotic about the EU and millions hate him. I also don’t like to be told by governments and businesses how to vote, that’s why we have a secret vote. There’s a lot of anger against Cameron. I think any xenophobia and racism is stirred up more by the remain side, not the leave side. I am very much in favour of a fair immigration policy. The Australian points system was a big deciding factor for me. I’m not sure if it would be any easier for my wife under the points system. Depends on the level, but I would hope as a British citizen I wouldn’t be discriminated against. I’m very happy with the result, it should keep all of them occupied for years and less time to start picking fights around the world.
1/1	I voted for brexit for various reasons but the main reason is the lack of transparency in the EU.Most people I know cannot name even one MEP .
1/1	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do.
1/1	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do. Doesn't personally benefit me.
1/1	I voted for one of the options given, to leave, not hang around waiting until the EU decides to give us a really bad deal.
0/0	I voted for remain, as did all of my family and friends and everyone I have asked. I don't understand it. Who are the people who voted to leave? And what do they want? The leave voters they have shown on TV only say catch phrases about immigration, like that guy on channel 4 news last night. But that is so crazy. Now we are out of the EU, what incentive does France have to detain illegal immigrants at Calais for us? I know lots of people who are overjoyed with this result. My Chinese friends studying in London are celebrating the lowered exchange rate, and their parents are waiting for the fire sale of British assets. My investment firm friends are too busy making money from this new crisis. But I am not happy about it. I am sitting here feeling very sad that this is possibly the end of the country I love. The United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
1/1	I voted leave and I would still vote leave if given the choice. Before you lot jump to the same argument i always see on the sub reddit Immigration was never a key point for me and I would happily accept free movement and even free trade with the EU (which was the agreement under the EEC long before Orwell's nightmare existed). I would also be happy finding it. After all what is a few million to a great trade deal and happy more stable neighbours. However I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain. In the mean time we all have to deal with an unelected President and commission (who control all the power) and a parliament that acts as a smoke screen. It genuinely makes me sad that we live in a country where so many want to willingly abandon the democracy we fought so hard for in exchange for trinkets. As far as what I think of this new deal I despise that to and I believe this was our Prime ministers plan all along to give us a terrible deal and say "it's this or no brexit". So you lot may well get your dictatorship after all and I hope it's worth selling what little freedoms we have left to our multinational overlords. This is truly what it felt like to be a roman after the fall
0/0	I voted leave and deeply regret it. What have I done to my country? I was influenced by lies and illegally bought Facebook ads. I didn't do any research about what Brexit would mean.
0/0	I voted leave and do regret it now. I now think its a fucking stupid idea.
1/1	I voted leave and don't like either labour or the tories. I can't see workers rights being eroded like some are claiming. Any party that tries to get rid of maternity leave, sick pay, holidays etc will be fucked in any future election
1/1	I voted leave and i can assure you it's not all about immigration. I love Europe and european people, it's just that our democratic rights are completely drowned out in the EU in favour of large businesses and a collectivised economy.
0/0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind. It was a stupid choice. New referendum is needed
1/1	I voted leave and proud!
1/1/1/1	I voted leave and would again A leave vote means more chance of Scottish independence, at which point Scotland can join the EEU & Schengen
1/1	I voted leave because I think that large, all-encompassing systems of government are dangerous.
1/1	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests.
1/1	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests. I do not want a democratically deficient, unaccountable, unaudited and unelected foreign institution to make decisions for me and my country. Brexit is happening and I see hope and prosperity for myself and for my fellow British citizens
1/1	I voted leave because the EU has become corrupt and unaccountable and does not serve the people.
1/1	I voted leave because the EU is going to collapse, their trade laws are problematic for the UK, their immigration policy causes many problems, so on
1/1	I voted leave but I didn’t really want to leave Europe
1/1	I voted leave but surely that post was a joke. If not I can only assume a trained gorilla has acquired keyboard skills. I am ashamed to be associated with such utter tripe. Giving leave voters a bad name and fuelling leaves ammo, muppet.
1/1	I voted leave for all these reasons. Hopefully now we have a new government we can make Great Britain great again. 🇬🇧🇬🇧
1/0/1	I voted leave for empowerment, and to feel like my voice is heard and can influence change. The compromise to remain was too high a price. It’s a reminder that democracy does exist here. The present leaders have failed to address the have-nots, preferring to placate the haves. Visiting London in 2014 there were no signs of a recession. The city has alienated itself from the rest of England. It felt obscene. I have worked in mental health for 30 years. In that time I have observed that society is reflected in the people who access our services. The biggest issues are feeling connected, or rather disconnected, in society. The majority are probably the people who have the smallest voice, but who rely on others to advocate for them. How much energy and financial support is offered to EU nationals who are vulnerable, when our own are ignored? I haven’t seen any EU benefits to mental health at all. I’m struggling to understand what they’ve done. This is an opportunity. If people can see beyond the loss, and see it as an opportunity, we can affect change for people and how they experience life. The people who are actually living the life made the choice. All these people who are aggrieved. Why weren’t they out campaigning? All these smug people who thought it wouldn’t happen ... it shows a real sense of arrogance.
1/1	I voted leave meaning clean break out of europe totally. No deal and keep your grubby hands off the British tax payers 39 billion.
1/1	I voted leave that meant leave!!!!!!!
1/0	I voted leave with sadness, the EU could have been a great thing. The politicians behind the EU have turned it into an institution with limited goals - the preservation of the EU and long term federalism.They stopped listening to the concerns of the people a long time ago.I wish our European friends well but I fear now we have left the EU will become increasingly insular and will stagnate.
1/1	I voted leave, and it wasn't because of "immigration" or because i am "uneducated" or "racist". I want the EU countries to get better and stronger there shouldn't be a reason to leave your home country, your country is to provide for you, that's jobs healthcare, education, and a home if one of these things is the reason you have to leave then there's a problem, and its with your own country that things needs to change. Using the British or any other nations tax payers money is shameful. I know i said immigration wasn't the reason i voted leave but the people who come here for work thinking its a good thing are wrong if you have too immigrate here just to get a job then your home country has let you down and NEEDS TO CHANGE! Britain and its money wont help change the core problem which is too many EU countries cant provide for there populace and use the free movement of people to pass the problem to others like the UK and Germany, France. I voted leave to make the country's in the EU stronger because hanging on another nations apron strings isn't the way to go.
1/1	I voted leave, i couldn't give a f..k what rich people think. Just get on with it !!!!
1/1	I voted leave. Everything you're talking is rubbish.
1/1	I voted leave. I am a migrant to the UK from outside the EU. My parents worked hard all their lives here, and we are happy as a family here. We never claimed benefits, and we have paid taxes and contributed to our local communities. I ended up marrying a foreign woman outside the EU and went through a challenging process to get my wife a VISA. All other migrants should be prepared to do the same, and not treat the UK as a transitional home. The government and it's people have the right (and a duty, God forbid), to put it's own interests at it's forefront - I fail to see why this is even an issue? This time democracy won - and people continue to complain? Why?
1/1	I voted leave. I wish I had put a bet on the result. I believe the odds for leaving at 10pm on the night was something like 8 to 1 or something around that figure
1/1	I voted leave. It has nothing at all to do with immigration. I love Europe, but the EU has done it's job. now it has become an undemocratic, bloated beurocracy and it no longer acts in British national interests. I have lived in the far east for a large part of my life and spent a large chunk of my time in the USA and south America. We do not need to be chained to an Eurocentric attitude to trade and relations. We are not turning our back on the EU, we are opening the doors to the rest of the world and we are doing it on OUR terms, not the EU's.
1/1	I voted out ,I win u lose..
1/1/1	I voted out, knew exactly what I voted for and have had zero regrets voting leave!! Utter horseshit that leave voters regretted their vote. Total bollocks.
0/0	I voted reject Brexit. I am a British national living in Spain, the EU has been hugely beneficial to me.
0/0	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again. I do have valid gripes against some stuff the EU does, and there are issues that may never really be resolved (common agriculture policy/fisheries policy etc). At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger.
0/0	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again. I do have valid gripes against some stuff the EU does, and there are issues that may never really be resolved (common agriculture policy/fisheries policy etc). At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger. At least one preferred option for trade after brexit would cost businesses here more than we used to pay the EU (by multiple billions, based on estimates) Thanks to the leave vote the economy is now doing less good than it was, the military is even more underfunded due to the exchange rate crashing, xenophobic and racist attacks saw a huge surge after the vote as well. Basically every week is another bad bit of news about something we are losing, something damaging our country and something going wrong, as a result of Brexit and voting to leave. NHS recruitment is a big one. We are now looking at probably decades of austerity, and once we actually leave, it will likely get pretty shitty. As it is, things are not too bad yet because it is a long gradual process. Thus far, there hasn't been any real positive news at all out of this whole debacle.
0/0	I voted remain and I regret the over all vote, but this video is ridiculous..
0/0	I voted remain and if we were to have a second referendum I would vote remain again. However, what happens if we lost again? The people's vote campaign looks awfully similar to the first time round. Wealthy individuals and middle-class students making a lot of noise in the major cities whilst willfully ignoring the concerns of those outside of London, Manchester, Liverpool etc.
0/0	I voted remain as I used to live on the continent. Concessions for Cameron would have avoided all of this. Learn your lessons EU. Dont treat member states as your property and listen to the people not corporations.
0/0	I voted remain but I can see how the EU has a serious democratic deficit and that is unsustainable and they are not planning to change.
0/0/0	I voted remain but feel that in the right hands Brexit could have worked. It was hijacked by Mr Johnson: a career opportunist and fantasist - and a dangerous one at that. The issue for me was why people voted in the first place to leave and suggest it was because people outside London felt they were being ignored and due to the lack of real info. at the time voted for their own visions of Brexit.
1/1	I voted remain but having watched how bitter and twisted the E.U. have treated Great Britain the quicker we are to leave, the happier I will be.
0/0	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK.
0/0	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK. I might not agree with it but it’s silly to dismiss half the country as stupid and racist.
0/0	I voted remain but respect the views of the those who voted leave. To call people racist just because they wanted to leave the EU is not only wrong but insulting.
1/1	I voted remain but would now vote leave.
0/0	I voted remain in the referendum because i believed all of this mess should have been delt with first.
0/0	I voted remain today... United we stand, divided we fall.
0/1	I voted remain, and I am against a 2nd referendum. Well all knew what we were voting for respect the decision and work together.
0/0	I voted remain, and if I had a chance again would vote remain again !!!.
0/0	I voted remain, but London will remain a world financial centre whatever happens.
0/0	I voted remain, but if I had voted leave then I would be all wrapped up in the sovereignty nonsense, and I would be pretty disappointed. Or the other one they all deny is that they simply don’t like foreigners, well I would have mixed feeling there, they certainly were successful in reducing the number of doctors, nurses, health professionals coming to work in our National Health service.
1/0	I voted remain, but that odious fellow crapping on the House of Commons because opposition exists within it makes me want to leave immediately with no deal.
0/1	I voted remain, lost, accepted it. I’m no remoaner, no one likes a sore loser so get over it or move to Europe. Simple as
0/0	I voted remain, love Europe and its people
0/0	I voted remain, was disappointed at the result, but over the past 3 and a half years became fed up with people who tried to subvert the democratic wishes of the majority.
0/0	I voted remain.
0/0	I voted remain...
1/1	I voted to LEAVE. Did I vote to deal? No! No! No!
1/1	I voted to kick out immigrants so the rich have to pay real wages
1/1	I voted to leave
1/1	I voted to leave as did the majority but the London centric establishment
1/1	I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
1/1	I voted to leave because I the voter and taxpayer have no democratic control over the machinations of the Commission
1/1	I voted to leave because QMV is undemocratic and that since 2009 any decision against the EUs’ agenda to consolidate its own power and to increase federalisation fails because of QMV. Britain doesn’t want a closer federalised union, the EU does, these are two irreconcilable viewpoints. But hey ho, it's much easier just to call me a stupid uneducated racist right.
1/1	I voted to leave because open door immigration is irresponsible when a country that Housing, Hospitals,Doctors and many other services are struggling to cope. I don't have any problem with anybody from the EU or any other country coming to the UK but the numbers need to be controlled so public services are not overwhelmed. While clueless politicians put whats best for the EU before the UK
1/1	I voted to leave for a few reasons. As far as I know, the UK pays more money to the EU than what it gets back. So basically if you give your friend £50 a week, they only give you £40 in return (this isn't accurate, it is for arguements sake) which should be a good enough reason to want to leave. Also I feel Britain can be prosperous outside of the EU, we should be allowed to make and abide by our own laws. I feel that many of the other stronger countries in the EU will follow suit in the next decade.
1/0/1/1/1/1	I voted to leave for independence and i would vote leave again, Our prime minister May is the problem not Brexit.
1/1	I voted to leave purely because of sovereignty.
1/1	I voted to leave the EU because I want the British economy to collapse :)
1/1	I voted to leave the EU. I rejected a supranational government. What would it take you to understand the danger to democracy the EU represents
1/1	I voted to leave this EU train. It was meant purely as a trading union. Nothing else. It is becoming the soviet union in Western guise and I do not want it. I do not want any laws coming from Brussels. That and the EU has pretty much gutted countries like Greece. Nobody would invite an stranger into your home without some kind of assessment of the person you invite in. Not because you are racist which seems to be the go to argument because leftists cannot seem to engage in sensible conversation. I want people assessed prior to entry. Because I give a dam about those living within. One of the many reasons the UK is now in such a state is that we have had such an influx of migrants that we now do not have the infrastructure to deal with it. We have an incredible housing shortage, our schools are pretty much full and the the NHS is on the verge of crumbling because it simply cannot cope anymore. If you really want to move to a different country is it really that much trouble applying for a visa and being checked to ensure you are not a danger to the populous? I personally don't think so. You should always be in driving seat of your own destiny. The Americans fight for independence against the British was not much different. Any American wish to be governed by the UK? Would be the same for India. The EU is nothing more than empire. And every empire in history has failed, and for good reason.
0/0	I voted to leave,and I regret that…
0/0	I voted to remain in the EU. There were never any benefits to Brexit which weren’t massively outweighed by the downsides, even if we’d had a competent government to take us through the negotiations.
1/0/0/0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
0/0	I voted to stay
0/0/0	I voted to stay because I knew brexit was going nowhere from the get go
1	I voted to stay now I know more I wish I wouldâ€™ve voted to leave
1/1	I voted to support the UK fishing industry as UK fisherman are only allocated 30% of the quota for fishing in their own territorial waters. Hopefully all UK jobs, businesses and perhaps companies will now stop importing goods and food that could be bought in the UK, in turn supporting UK industry and creating jobs. Perhaps we will eventually start producing world class cars and machinery again, because all of that’s gone tits up since joining the EU with all the rules and regulations. The EU is failing. The euro is collapsing, and the whole EU is going backwards while the rest of the world overtakes. I am not a Nazi racist and have no problem with immigration or free movement of people. I do, however, have a problem with immigrants being able to claim child support for children that don’t live in the UK. I don’t agree with the remain campaign’s false statistics, blocking fishermen’s protests in the Thames, and shouting abuse at working class men just trying to provide for their families and general sneakily hidden foul play. Truthfully none of my friends or colleagues are having second thoughts either, everyone here is happy. We knew the pound would temporarily fall, and knew the euro would too. I also know the pound will recover, more than recover in fact. Not sure if the euro will recover. Maybe we were never stronger in Europe, but Europe was stronger with us. I hope the media will start giving all the facts, not just the scaremongering ones. I hope for the success of the working man and UK businesses, not just multinational businesses, millionaires or the upper class who make all their money from investment banking.
0/0	I wait to see how many work dodgers will come off benefits to fruit pick or dig up potatoes in all weathers then!!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I wanna stay in the EU
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I wanna stay in the EU 😭😭😭
1/1	I want Brexit, the british people would be saved from article 13
1/1	I want UK to be a democratic global trading nation instead of being tied to decaying and undemocratic EU
1/1	I want UK to be independent and NOT a EU' province !!
1/1	I want a hard border at Dover to keep the EU out of GREAT BRITAIN
1/1	I want a stable country where people from all counties across the UK are heard and not fed scraps from the south. I don’t want to fear that when my daughter has children there’s no room in schools due to overcrowding, or if she has health issues a medical appointment doesn’t take longer than growing a baby. We should feel safe in our jobs and not feel as though if we’re not willing to work seven days a week, 10 hours a day then someone can quite easily be drafted in from abroad and subsequently thrown on the unemployment pile further straining local economy. When every Briton lives a suitable standard of life, then my tax money can be spent elsewhere. When the systems put into place – NHS, state schools, housing – are well-equipped and capable of looking after each individual residing in the UK, then we can accept more and do right by others. We, the little people, or even the big boys that apparently run the country haven’t got full control over what happens, and if suffering a downturn in wages due a weaker economy over trading deals is a price to pay to make the country and its people better educated and in a full bill of health then so be it. The image of racism is far from true and shouldn’t be used as a smear against the voiceless that live day-to-day with the consequences of the decision makers that reside in a London borough away from real life and constantly roll the shit downhill. What the writers in a swanky London office or sat at home at a fine oak table with an Apple Mac drinking espresso from Starbucks don’t realise is that the leave voters from wherever they’re from aren’t afraid of rolling up their sleeves and putting in the graft that will make the country great.
1/1	I want an independent country!
1/1	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for
1/1	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for !
1/1	I want hard brexit and then we can invest that 39 billion into our own car factories, plane factories etc. The government should provide OUR people with tax free loans to start up new enterprise ! We want NO DEAL !!!
1/1	I want my Country back
1/1	I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
0/0	I want the UK to STAY in the EU
1/1	I want the UK to make it's own laws
0	I want the UK to stay in European Union forever...
1/1	I want the laws that we are governed by in Britain to be made in Britain & to be made by people who can be held to account by the British electorate
0/0/0	I want to be with EU
1	I want to leave because: 1. the EU is fundamentally undemocratic - only the unelected commission can propose laws, the parliament is a mere amending chamber - there is no true separation of legislature and executive. How many years did it take for us to secure universal suffrage and its now being destroyed under our noses without people realising what is going on. 2. the vast majority of our laws are now made by the EU, and they are now unashamedly pressing on with an EU army - ie. we aint seen nothing yet 3. The EU is controlled by big business, big banks, Soros etc- its run by the establishment for their own benefit, the people no longer count - look at the tricks that are being played out now as the will of the people is regarded with contempt as it does not fit in with the establishment line 4. 20 billion quid a year to pay for this when an increasing number rely on foodbanks and essential services are still being cut. 5. The Euro has crippled most of southern Europe and is stopping the richer members from developing economically 6. Our country is being subsumed into this dysfunctional superstate when it could be a leading player in world trade 7. Open-door policy has led to a flooding of the lower paid labour market with a resulting compression of wages
1/1	I want to leave the EU so Britain can rule Britain again.
1/1	I want to leave the EU. I just don't like being part of it. Its not based on economic studies, immigration or anything like that. I just don't want to be part of it the same way i prefer Rugby to Football. Why do we need to have such complex arguments for these things. I want Great Britain to be truly independent, then i want a real trail blazer of a party leader to win the next election and i want this mess of a country sorted out once and for all. Seriously, whats so wrong with just going it alone? Treat the country like a startup....great things could happen.
1/1	I want to leave, not because im anywhere close to the right or because i hate europe, cause i dont. its actually because i feel the EU is a twisted state thats lied to us and is set to become the next fascist state, if america doesnt. it was promised to be the holy economic union that would "make europe great again" and instead its a political union that controls courts and parliaments and im not allowed to vote in anyway on how its run, where its run or its primary objectives. it controls me and my country in ways i deem unacceptable and this is the only way i could change it.
1/1	I want to save our country from becoming part of a united States of Europe, don't believe me read the treaties.
1/1	I want to see an end to the corrupt EU Dictatorship, No Deal will hit the destruct button for them.
1	I want to see the EU project fall apart. It does more harm than good, it won't be reformed, it's not democratic and it has frankly been a sinking ship for a while now. The last time there were bailouts, it was widely acknowledged that future bailouts were inevitable and all they served to do was kick the can down the road for a eurozone that is fundamentally flawed. Almost every beneficial agreement from being inside the EU can and will most likely remain in place. The difference is now we can act in our own self interest. As an example, switzerland is outside the EU but is part of the single market, one of the stipulations being free movement of people. However, when there was the migrant crisis they simply said "fuck it" and closed their borders. Many other European countries wished they could have done the same but simply lacked the freedom to do so. I would go as far as to say the average British person does not think Multi-culturalism is a good thing or that what people call "isolationism" is a bad thing. This is different from racism but the left will paint it however they will. A 2013 poll by British Social Attitudes said 77% of voters endorsed reducing immigration. If the left wants to label 77% of the British public as ignorant racists they can go right ahead.
1/1	I want to set Great Britain free and lets start trading with the other 85 Countries and be proud to leave the EUROPE BEHIND.
0/0	I want to stay in EU to help keep peace in Europe.
0/0	I want to stay in the EU because I don't want to see those jobs go..and the workers being left in the same state we were.
0/0	I want to stay in the EU.
1/1	I want us to make our own decisions. Europe is a mess. Let's fix ourselves by ourselves
1/1	I wanted out of the European Union because I knew it would be best for how I wanted Britain.
1/1	I wanted the UK to leave the EU
0/0	I wanted to stay
0/0	I wanted to stay :(
1/1	I wanted to stay in the EU. But I voted to leave. He depicts those who voted leave to be old, xenophobic, less educated and nationalists. All my family are Irish including myself and I also have a BSc (hons) degree and I love to travel around the world where I enjoy meeting and speaking to others. I also have dated other ethnic people. So how do I fit into your bullshit narrative.
0	I wanted to stay in the European Union
1/1/1/1/1	I was 20 when I voted to leave and I have no regrets. I want us to be able to have our self determination as a people and stop the EU, a state too impoverished to pay it's own debts but brand us British as criminals for wanting to rule ourselves. The sooner we leave the EU the better. Hopefully then we can have freer, fairer trade with every nation in the world.
1/1	I was 22 when I voted for brexit now I'm 23 and I will still vote for brexit.
0/0	I was 60-40 in favour of Remain. After Boris Johnson's ridiculous outburst comparing the EU to Hitler I'm now 100% #VoteStay #EUref
1/1	I was Leave then and I’m leave now VOTE LEAVE 🇬🇧
0/0	I was Remain for a long while, then for a minute or two I teased with Leave before snapping myself out of it. I'm sure that the EU might be weaker without the UK, but the UK would definitely be weaker without the EU.
0/0	I was a member of the Conservative Party. I campaigned in past for it. After this I will never vote Conservative again. Brexit is nothing other than economic suicide which will only benefit the mega rich like Rees Mogg, Murdoch etc..
0/0	I was absolutely gutted by the result. I still feel we should have remained in. However, it's vital that the British people unite to make a success of this. There are definitely opportunities and if 48% of the population stand around whinging we won't have a chance of making this work for us
1/1	I was always confident LEAVE would win, but after the main tv debate where Sturgeon, Rudd and Eagle were such a car crash, then I knew leave would win.
1/0	I was asleep at 11pm. Dreaming of better days and what might have been
0/0/0	I was born an EU citizen and have enjoyed the freedoms and privileges it brought. It's all been taken away from me, and from all the other British citizens who didn't just stay in their lounges reading the Daily Mail.
1/1	I was completely for BREXIT. In fact, I would be happy if Germany pulled out of the European Union and stood on her own feet. Being economically the most powerful country in Europe, why should the Germans who worked hard to attain this status share their wealth.
0/0	I was completely shocked by the Brexit result. 60% of the voters in my city and 62% of the voters in Scotland voted to remain in the EU so I thought it would be a clear win for "remain" but I hadn't realised just how pro-leave the rest of the UK was. In the Scottish independence referendum, I voted for Scotland to stay part of the UK because I wasn't convinced that the potential benefits of independence outweighed the potential negatives. Now though, I think I probably would prefer to be in the EU to being in the UK, if I had to choose just one of them. I've no idea what will happen. There's a general election next month where, presumably, Scotland will elect fifty-odd SNP MPs again and the UK will end up with a Conservative government so people here will feel unrepresented.
1/0	I was dismayed at how democracy was dismissed as ‘populism’ by the BBC etc. We should not be afraid of democratic process as people are actually for the most part pretty sensible. In fact studies have shown that personality disorders such as narcissism are more rife in the political classes and senior business leaders. Narcissists are attracted to power and people lacking normal compassion will latch onto ideologies. Therefore, it is imperative that normal people are listened to and would be political dictators controlled. This is why I support Brexit and I still like Our European neighbours and wish them well.
1/0/0	I was happy to stay but i am thankfull democracy has been adheared to and people "refusing" to accept it just look like and absolute idiot, leave the country go live in europe
0/0	I was in London earlier. Didn't see many foreign people celebrating all white British. Didn't like the atmosphere and felt it was very rasist. It's in God's hands now.
0/0	I was in London when it happened. I remember walking around a premiere European Capital that tangibly felt like less of a European Capital than it had just a year earlier, and thinking solemnly "These poor bastards. Glad I live in the good ol' US of A where we would never do something this stupid."
1/1	I was in favour of EU reform, but it became clear with Cameron’s failed attempts that the EU would never reform. It is a fanatical, extremist project that is in total denial that it is failing. I therefore voted leave.
1/-1	I was in favour of it.
1/1	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'.
1/1	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'. The more I learn about the ambitions, unaccountability and record of the EU and the Commision the more I am against it. How could the manufactured migrant crisis happen? It took the stripping of national sovereignty and overt threat of retaliation from Brussles to enable this catastrophe. And Britain will not be the last to abandon it's membership- you can count on that. Thank god.
0/0	I was just discussing with a leaver in another forum how curtailing freedom of movement would adversely affect my family’s lives. He simply did not get it. His eventual position was that he couldn’t afford foreign holidays anyway so nobody else should have one, ever, but mainly he wanted Romanians to all go home. It’s like arguing with a paper bag, honestly. But what was abundantly clear was that it was all abut him. All his points were totally self-serving, and devoid of any empathy for the consequences anyone else might have to suffer. This is why I don’t like leavers.
1	I was never a Eu citizen I have never held a passport I have always been a subject of the queen
1/1	I was not asked if I wanted to ne tuled by Brussels, a couple of elite MP’s signed our country over to the EU without our consent.
1/-1	I was not surprised.I was expecting this for a long time..............
1/1	I was on the fence until the very last minute. The major points that swung it for me: I do not believe in a federal Europe, I don't trust DC deal on a Referendum on ever closer union. Inside of this, I do not believe in wealth redistribution inside of the union except through means of trade and aid where it's needed. I don't believe the EU acts in our interest, nor would I except it to do so I would like our Government to have control over our borders and our money. That said, and I stress, I have no problem what so ever with immigrants as people, I do have some problem with the scale immigration - although I'll be surprised if that changes. I do not like the smuggness of the EU leaders, see DC's attempt at a new deal and even though our MEPs where united about the Ports regulation we were ignored. I did not like be condescended by the Remain campaign. Whilst I did find the Leave campaign to also be rather flawed, these flaws where blown out of proportion by Remain. (IE the 350mil figure IS still a valid one .. yes we spend much of that ourselves, no we couldn't just spend it on the NHS if we left, but that is what we loose direct control over) If we weren't already in the EU, we'd never even dream of entering it now
0/0	I was opposed to Brexit and my reasons for that are still there. Our exit has happened and I agree that we must now make the best of a bad job. Realism. But Mr Johnson should stop relying on windy rhetoric and make the best of it - realism.
0/-1/0	I was pretty vocal about being anti-Brexit before the referendum vote.
0/1	I was so thrilled that we won … I actually believed Theresa May when she said Brexit means Brexit — very stupidly of me — and I think I gave the impression that I rather walked away. I’m not going to walk away this time
1/0	I was thinking of moving to Britain for work but brexit will destroy everything. On the other hand Europe is useless, maybe brexit is the best solution for Britain and that's what matters the most
0/0	I was told there would be a dividend. Maybe they meant to the owners of all those outsourcing companies we will be paying small fortunes to make this gigantic cluster fuck slightly less gigantic.
0/0	I was waiting for victorious hate messages for me to come in. Would have been nice to be proven wrong, but it wasn’t to be. I’m not interested in sharing them. But let me say: your hate hasn’t silenced me before, it won’t do so now. Enjoy your Brexit & #BrexitDay. You own it now.
0/0	I was woken up early by the thought of how I would feel if #Brexit happens. It's not good. Intense despair would be one emotion, and extreme anger and hate would be another. If a few million people feel like me, this country will be heading for very bad times. #StopBrexit
0/-1	I weep that anyone even needs to be told this. Why the hell are we so bloody stupid.
1/-1	I welcomed brexit for easier regulation on business yet am seeing little in that direction
1/-1	I went out yesterday and no one mentioned Brexit at all. The sun had come up, there was water in the taps, electricity at the sockets, and prescription drugs were freely available. I expect the same will happen at the closure of the trade deal in a years time. Life goes on, but you wouldn't believe it from some of the comments on social media and in the DT.
0/0/1	I went to bed a Remainer and woke up a Rejoiner. No surrender! #RejoinEU
1/1	I went to five of the best pubs in London and to Parliament Square. The atmosphere was amazing. Strangers shaking each others hands. Absolutely brilliant day out in London. So glad that I was at this historic moment...
0/0/0	I will NEVER be bullied and blackmailed into accepting any form of #Brexit. May's deal leaves us permanently weaker; Corbyn's deal would do exactly the same. Give us a #PeoplesVote. Otherwise, martial law is on all who brought us to this point.
0/0	I will always be a European. I will always think, and act, and move through the world as a European. I will always live by the values of inclusion, kindness, community and solidarity. #Brexit is a Crime Scene. One day the real tale will be told. #StillEuropean #AlwaysEuropean
1/1	I will await today's excuse as to why remainers' promises did not come true
0/0	I will be 100% honest with you, if the UK vote leave on Thursday I will be ashamed to call myself British, I will have no option but to apply for my Finnish passport as I would feel sickened if I had to tell people I was British.
0/0	I will be fine. Just not as rich as I might have been. Enjoy unemployment, losing your house, poverty, misery, and depression, you mugs.
0/0/0	I will be registering to vote this week. I will be voting to stay in the EU.
1/1	I will be voting leave because I believe that Britain must be a self-governing, democratic independent nation in order to ensure that it both preserves it's cultural identity and delivers economic prosperity for generations to come.
1/1	I will be voting leave, The most important issues for me are immigration and sovereignty so it makes sense for me to vote to leave. I feel that both sides have been just as bad and have been trying to scaremonger people into voting for what they want, but this seems to be a common thing in British politics, a similar sort of "Its the end of the world!" thing happened when the Scottish referendum was happening.
1/1	I will be voting to Leave because I don't like having to answer to Brussels and I want us to be able to control our own borders.
1/1	I will expect my democratic vote honoured a full independent Britain, No deal is the deal. We never voted for deals we voted out.
0/0	I will miss the UK! I think you gave up too fast. Of course the EU is far away of beeing perfect but to say good bye...a little bit childish!?
0/0	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support negation of what has continued to be an extremely successful peace project in Europe
0/0	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support restrictions on my children's rights in the world
0/1	I will no longer be involved in day to day anti Brexit activism on social media
0/0	I will not support Brexit as I can see no benefit to it
0/1	I will put us back in
1/1	I will say I did vote partly because of immigration and other reasons, but it was mainly for sovereignty. EDIT - OP, the media has made leave votes how to be racist. Whilst I am sure some are, the large majority of leave votes just want control of our country back.
1/1/1/1	I will vote leave. True, our economy will suffer in the short term, but the EU has been wallowing in deep economic trouble for a while now, and it still has not recovered. I honestly could not care less about immigration.
1/1/1	I will vote to leave the EU. The happiest and most prosperous countries in Europe are Switzerland and Norway; non EU countries. Britain retains the pound and drives on the left. Britain had to sever Commonwealth ties to join the EU. Britain must set aside EU constraints to nurture old and new ties with other countries of the World.
0/0	I wish Britain weren't so small minded, I want to stay in Europe and the eu but it will never happen until everyone who is a teen now becomes 18 and all the racists die off
0/-1	I wish Great Britain all the best in spite of choosing Brexit! Good luck, friends!
0/0	I wish for Britain to get poor and isolated after Brexit. No immigrant should ever come there as the British pound will be valued less than a US dollar. They would have long quees in the EU Embassy to get the Shenghen Visa. UK would lose all investors and all automotive industry to Ireland, no more Range Rover, Jaguar, Mini Cooper with the right wheel drive. That's gonna be a show to watch
1/1	I wish i had the resources to produce a pro-brexit video of this quality.
0/0	I wish non of this was happening
0/0	I wish the EU well and I'm deeply embarrassed that the short sighted, right wing bigotry of Farage and co. has won the day. There are no benefits to the UK of leaving the EU and I'm sure that the EU will continue to grow and strengthen in our absence. At least they won't have to put up with the childish, obstructive antics of the Brexit Party any longer.
0/0	I wish the UK wouldn't leave the EU, we can achieve so much more if we are united.
1/1	I wish the best for UK Be unite Be united kingdom Be independent
1/1	I wish the media would stop making it out that everyone in Scotland is against brexit because I and many others are so happy to be out.
0/1	I wish the older Brexit supporters would show a little compassion to we the young who will after live with there vote to leave instead of refusing to countenance the fact that we will suffer for years to come.
0/0	I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit. My country is a laughing stock right now.
0/0	I wish they get it over and done with. I voted Remain for lots practical reasons (work, travel outside EU etc) but even I wouldn't want to stall the exit. The big problem is the uncertainty. I don't trust the leaders to make decent decisions but they have to at least decide something.. no one had a plan... idiots.
0/0	I wish they would fire all that white smoke at all the people who voted leave
1/1	I wish we could leave as well ...Good for you Brits, lot's of respect for taking your country back ... a frustrated Belgian civilian.
1/1	I wish we had gone with no deal. And not given an inch or Euro to these mealy mouthed Eurocrats.
0/0	I wish you the best UK citizen, for a dark time is coming and this one smells like 1930's. I will mourn your leaving next year, whatever it means to you Brexiters
0/0	I wished I could of voted to remain.
0/0	I wished we wouldn’t leave the EU
1/1	I wobbled a bit this morning when I saw the reactions on Facebook. Around 98% of my Facebook friends were strongly remain. At our staff briefing the headteacher talked about it being a bad day. All my colleagues seemed to have voted remain, so I’ve kept my vote private. I’ve yet to come out on Facebook and I’m not sure I will, as I may have a lot of anger thrown at me. The EU is doomed to fail in the long- to very-long term, and Britain will do very well outside it. The EU is undeniably failing economically, and its principal solution seems to be increasing what is most likely to be causing the failure. I can foresee popular movements against the EU rising in several countries, indeed they already seem to be starting in the countries that have been in the EU the longest. It could become, as it has in the UK, an easy target for disaffected people to lash out at. I’m a Green party member. I think Labour have a strong chance in the next general election, and hopefully they can introduce proportional representation to produce the progressive, coalition government this country could have.
0/0	I won't be happy at the loss of rights and access to the EU.
0/0/0	I won't stop using #Brexit. I'll keep reminding #LiarJohnson of his false promises, and his corruption & criminality in pursuit of the impossible.
0/0	I wonder how long it will take for the first Brexiter to openly admit some of 'project fear' warnings were actually spot on?
0/0	I wonder how low can UK sink? Lost its empire, about to lose its economic might, will likely lose some of its provinces. We could be talking about England pretty soon.
0/0	I wonder how many Brexiteers will stand up to be counted when things start going wrong, now that they can't blame The EU....? ;)
0/0	I wonder how many pro brexit people would change their vote rightnow.
0/0	I wonder how will Scotland and the Northern Island react if the Brexit will really happen!! Hopefully they move away from the UK and join the EU
0/-1	I wonder if the Queen’s applied for a German Passport
0/0	I wonder if the Queen’s applied for a German Passport. #Brexit
0/-1	I wonder if the UK see the irony in leaving the EU maybe they can see how Ireland wanted to leave the British rule
1/-1	I wonder what language they’re speaking at the EU today!
0/0	I wonder why people who want to leave EU never give one good (or at least sensible) reason to do so...
0/0	I work in the EU, have done for years, i love it's people's, it's culture, it's diversity, food, beer, ladies, I'm more European than ever, tory hatred of the EU has cost us, our rights are going, but our youth will return us in time, I'm celebrating with pals in the EU
0/0	I work in the construction industry and know for a fact that young Brits are not attracted to the trades in the volumes they once were. The British workforce has got steadily older with the shortfall being filled by younger EU workers. The UK construction stands to lose up to 8 per cent of its workforce to Brexit putting the delivery of future infrastructure projects at risk.
1/1	I work in the development of power generation in the UK, my market was almost destroyed by EU red tape and misreading/interpretting of their own rules
0/0	I worry about the direction of the U.K. and U.K. politics and governance in the event of a Brexit.
0/0	I woudl have thought the Europeans would be so pissed off by us by now that they would be more then happy to kick us out by now. *ashamed to be english*
1/1	I would be over the moon if we left the self serving, thieving, lying #EU with a #NoDealBrexit They have taken enough from the people of Great Britain
1/-1	I would be rich beyond my wildest dreams. Moreso the population will see growth in manufacturing and jobs galore. If you listen to the remainers their only output is about project fear, these are the smoke & mirrors tactics of the elites and the establishment in the UK & EU.
0/0	I would continue to vote reject Brexit simply because brexit has already made some companies quietly relocate out of the UK.
0/1	I would dearly love to be able to take some blame for sabotaging Brexit. If it had been possible to slip a banana-skin under the whole wretched process, I would have. But actually, Remainers have been thoroughly sidelined and igored. All we’ve been able to do is sit on the sidelines, with the occasion cry of "we told you that would happen".
0/1/0/0	I would delete Donald Trump. I would delete Hillary Clinton. I would delete the man who was responsible for Brexit.
0/0	I would have Brussels before British any day
0/1/0	I would have preferred not to leave the EU, but Brexit is happening, so we need to accept it. Like it or not, we are all in this together now, and continuing to note the probable negative outcomes isn't helpful at this point.
1/-1	I would have thought that polls would now be looked at askance, they got Brexit wrong they got Trump wrong
1/1	I would have voted to leave because of the sovereignty issue.
0/0	I would laugh about it, if it wasn't so depressing. To start with, they made yes/no referendum about a way to complex matter, had a very close result, following a campaign full of misinformation and falls promises. To fulfill these promises would mean to get all the benefits of the EU without any of the obligations, which is ridiculous. May could have gone on and work with the parliament, to reach a deal with the EU to be a country like Norway (Very close in the EU, but not part of it). Instead she just ignored Parliament until the end, made a terrible compromise deal to fulfil some of the dumb promises made. Now parliament doesn't want that deal, no one wants a no-deal Brexit, but the time is running out and and a delay would result in the same problem just a few months later. It's just a total disaster from beginning to end.
0/0	I would like a video explaining why some people want no deal. Majority of the evidence ranges from bad to very bad. Thanks.
1/0/0	I would like to see economic reform where one person’s wealth isn’t the debt of another’s, and people are rewarded for their contribution rather than what they can extort from others through rents and fines. I’d like an economy where growth is genuine, which potentially means overhauling the whole banking system. I would like the bank to be disempowered from creating money and those powers going to central government, albeit a government whose aim is to represent its citizens rather than control them. The money supply should not be held in private hands. Politically, I would like to see Brussels and Westminster reformed, and arrogant politicians and public servants begin to serve public needs and not be bought like prostitutes by vested interests. Eventually, under the right circumstances, I would like to see us return to the EU, with more visionary and ideologically driven representatives that are forced to make themselves accountable to both their home population and the wider European population. Europe could be a fantastic political structure that would promote the growth and needs of all its people, but not with the current political mentality. The arrogance displayed by politicians here and all over Europe who suggest citizens are not “educated” enough to be left to decide is conceited and undemocratic. Chief among these is Jean-Claude Juncker. I am very sad we are leaving the EU, but the administration of both the EU and the UK need fundamental reform that promotes the lives of its citizens rather than loading them up with debt to pay for a defunct political and economic system. The absolutely wrong people are being put in charge of a economic and political system that no longer allows people to rise through the ranks. Immigration would not be such a problem if the UK built homes and infrastructure and trained adequate doctors, nurses and essential workers, but politics is deliberately creating scarcity. Take housing, where landlords are being helped turn everyone into tenants while demand for homes continues to be stoked by immigration, pushing up rents and making us poorer every year. These are moves towards a return to 19th century serfdom. Although I know the government and the Bank of England are the ones pushing people down, this vote was the only way to really hurt them.
0/0	I would like to see the leavers acknowledge their error once it starts hitting, and not divert the blame or project on others. But yeah, we know that is not going to happen. We know immigrants and the poor will get the blame for the crisis. They steal jobs, they take welfare, and they don't work -all at the same time-.
0/0	I would like to thank and congratulate my fellow remainers for behaving in such a tolerant, respectful and responsible way tonite. We've endured much provocation, but our dignified response will always be admired by the more neutral of observers among us. Ultimately, we can feel confident the facts and evidence will reverse this tragic mistake in the next few years. Until then, let the Brexiteers continue burying themselves.
0/0	I would like to vote but as I have lived outside the UK for more than 15 years I can't vote. However if the UK leaves it is likely that I will have to leave my job and return to the UK where I probably wont be able to find work so I will end up living on the dole and costing the UK tax payer money.
1/1/1	I would love to see the breakup of the EU. Nation states should free themselves from the voluntary shackles offered by cynical, deceitful, anti-democratic, sneering control freaks. I voted because of the almost insurmountable obstacles to reform in Europe. Other member states, and some of our own representatives, were far too keen on keeping in place the undemocratic practice of appointing rejected leaders to positions of power in Europe. The way the Mediterranean countries have been treated has also been a disgrace. The initial hit to the economy is going to be painful. I hope it passes as people get a grip on what’s actually happening. Trade is not ceasing, barriers are not being erected, hard-working Europeans aren’t being deported. I also hope the people of Britain will face the coming challenges united, and bury any ambition of demanding more referendums on previously settled matters. It’s the EU’s way to tell everyone to vote again, not ours.
1/1	I would never dream of voting Tory, and I am fully for Brexit. How does that fit into your condescending worldview?
1/1	I would never in a million years change my decision to leave.With the EU being exposed for what it is I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would want to remain and belong to such a corrupt, unelected undemocratic organisation run by a bunch of rabid clowns !!! - and they think leavers are thick!!!
0/1	I would never say this man was thick. I have respect for his views and admire the way in which he put them across. But he does clearly show a lack of understanding of the principles of the EU and the bigger economic picture #stopbrexit
1/0/1	I would put money on that brexit day poster being made by some remainers trying to rubbish bexiteers. Hopefully the police catchup with whoever did it and we find out.
1/1	I would rather just be out.
1/0	I would say for a very simple reason - the UK discriminates against those from outside the EU in favour of those inside. Those earning under £35,000 p/a have been forced to go back to their country of citizenship. It's unfair that someone without a job can enter the UK whilst a skilled person like yourself (I presume you have a Commonwealth background) has stringent visa requirements. My family migrated to the UK from the Commonwealth, and I feel disappointed that those with similar links would be discriminated against in favour of low-skilled migrants with poor to no proficiency in English. There are many other more general reasons for voting to leave the EU, such as preserving democracy (instead of handing power to an unelected commission), and the exposure to failing economies in southern Europe. For more information about those, I recommend watching 'Brexit the Movie' on YouTube.
0/1	I would simply like to give a big fuck you to all who voted leave
1/1	I would still VOTE LEAVE
1/1	I would vote leave all over again. Don't listen to these bias networks so fake and corrupt.
1/1	I would vote leave now more than ever, the lies and the people who are involved with the remain. Side make me even more. Enthusiastic to leave
1/1	I would vote to leave if I could.
0/0	I would vote to remain, if there is another clean vote to remain. England imports from china, not exports goods to china. I do not think you understand trade policies and the better position you are in within the EU. You have your own currency. You have greater influence in the EU. Now what? join NAFTA, you will have zero influence in that Batshit crazy system.
0/0	I wouldn't let this Government run a bath let alone trust them to deal with Brexit properly. Just bin Brexit and get back to normality.
1/0	I wouldn't mind europe becoming a single country, lets get it over with already
0/0	I wouldn't trust UK politicians to find their way out of a paper bag. Luckily, the economy doesn't rely on them but the Govt has enough influence to screw things up when times are good and worsen them when they're bad. Brexit will be a long, drawn out, painful and unecessary process which, like all divorces, will benefit lawyers the most! It'll take at least 5 years to complete after which we'll probably wonder why we bothered in the first place because the world is changing anyway due to unrelated factors and completely different reasons.
1/1	I wouldn't worry about barnier and tusk. They will be remembered as the men who presided upon the fall of the great eu experiment as more and more EU nations fall out with the Brussels dictatorship.
1/1	I wouldn’t blow them up. If I ever got into power I’d give you all £5,000 to £10,000 and ask you to leave. I don’t believe that Islam should be in the west, no. This is a Christian country
0/0	I wouldn’t trust a Brexiteer to make me a sandwich.
1/1	I wouldn’t worry much just give it time the EU will collapse especially with the rise of extreme right parties all over Europe. UK has been intelligent in leaving
1/0	I'd argue that remaining in the EU is in keeping with our history
0	I'd feel worse that leavers have stripped him of so many opportunities for his future.
0/0	I'd give my left testicle to have PM Trump for 8 years instead of Brexit.
1/1	I'd honestly prefere to just leave without a deal and end this charade.
0/1	I'd like to congratulate Brexiters on making us a vassal state for the next 11 months. A country of rule takers. And of course after that you can celebrate us becoming a vassal state of the USA.
1/1	I'd like to see a detailed account of what we allegedly owe this nest of gangsters before one penny is paid. Justify the £39Bn if you can, Barnier, then our side can put in a counter claim regarding how much the EU owes us as one of the 9 nations which actually pays into the EU budget.
0/-1	I'd like to see how no deal would affect the EU.
1/1	I'd rather be free with a bag of chips, than in chains at a 5 course dinner!! Congrats Britain you are free once more!!!
1/1	I'd rather nuke europe than stay in.
0/0	I'd rather see it not happening, but it will be a prime example of a fuck up, so no-one else will do the same mistake
0/0	I'd rather see it not happening, but it will be a prime example of a fuck up, so no-one else will do the same mistake.
0/-1/0	I'd tell the UK go someplace else for trade I wouldnt with the if I was the eu
1/1	I'll be dead, but I know that my children and their children...they will be British, independent - and it's a new era for them.
0/0	I'll be very surprised if the UK remains a whole after all this nonsense.
1/1	I'll be voting out, democracy and sovereignty are not things the eu takes seriously considering parliament has already practically given our sovereignty away early to Brussels which is illegal, proof of an unwillingness to fight for English common law and the English bill of rights, along with the introduction of mandatory registration of births which is a manufacture of consent to take my child under some cited bureaucracy which missed baby p... If we save the money we pay the eu and go for a basic income benefit for all Ontop of work, to end wage slavery child poverty, hunger, adult education and entrepreneurial barriers finally and save the job center finding me a job for less than the London living wage anyway, can't unionise, can't go to uni, can't find out when I'm being fired, or why without a tribunal which makes finding work harder next time. Meanwhile we bail out dodgy.financial institutions and.subsidise the rich for looking after their short term profits and.relocating manufacturing abroad paying less tax in the process while my local shopkeeper breaks his back for his wage and would get arrested if he couldn't afford it while those that can pay more early pay less last, our politicians are too disconnected from the power of the people the 97% at least. The eu is relic of a nwo we Need to abandon now n plan much later.. when it includes people like me and you, not a load of terrorists Obama, George and.Blair helped anger supporting wars we knew were illegitimate. Parliament next.
0	I'll be voting to remain. I haven't bothered paying any attention to the nonsense spouted by both campaigns. I've just made a value judgment of the situation and came to my own conclusion. Financially, it's a risk. Sure we could end up benefitting by leaving long term but the chances of us quickly securing a good trade deal aren't fantastic. Leaving the EU is a political statement and people are a little deluded for thinking we have a wealth of bargaining power. We don't. I can imagine a trade deal distinguishing between goods and services to our disadvantage. I'm not phased by the 'reclaim our parliamentary sovereignty' argument. It's not like we were unaware of the supremacy of EU law when agreeing (Lord Bridge's words come to mind: "there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas to which they apply"). Also, EU law is a bloody good tool for individuals. Common law fundamental rights are dubious. Convention rights give rise to interpretation or a DoI, that's about it. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights allows us to dis-apply existing domestic law (insofar as there is conflict). That is very useful for vindicating individuals' rights, and provides a useful check against the state given the lack of real accountability (political sovereignty of the electorate is a sham). I would have voted not to join the EU in the first place. We should be adhering to the principle of subsidiarity wherever possible. Devolution (even if at the expense of the Union) should have been preferred. But hey, now we're in the position we're in and we've got to deal with it. Academia would suffer post-Brexit and I imagine that's an important subconscious factor for me.
0/0	I'll believe it when I see it. What I expect from Johnson is a fake Brexit, and more of the same that Britain's been getting for the last thirty years.
1/1	I'll keep fighting for the best, most successful Brexit.
0/0	I'll move to Scotland, see ya Britain
0/0	I'll never for give them - or the idiots that voted for it.
1/1	I'll never taste a piece of bacon that tasted as good as this result.
1/1	I'll take the pain if there is any, just to be free from the E.U politicians who ridicule, insult and try controlling this country.
1/-1	I'll walk away from trade talks if EU tries to bind us to their rules
0/0	I'm #voteremain tomorrow because I have two young daughters who I want to have opportunities to work, study and travel freely across Europe
1/1	I'm 18 and I'm voting to leave. The media are making out as if loads of young people want to stay but I know loads of people my age who want to leave- it's not just older people!
1/1	I'm 19 and I voted out I must be a racist and uneducated obviously
1/1/1	I'm 40 married with 2 young children and a home owner. I've always been Pro Europe my whole life in fact I have been of the opinion that total Europe is the best solution. A European super state would dominate the world economically and politically. Unfortunately I'll be voting Leave. I'm doing this because of immigration only. The housing market is knackered and my children will struggle to own their own home when they grow up. I know this is because of government policy but if they aren't going to do anything about it then what choice do we have? If immigration can be reduced then demand for housing and public services may stop climbing so rapidly. I'm also angry at Europe because when Cameron went to euro leaders telling them that we were unhappy and may vote to leave they didn't take him seriously and gave some very insignificant concessions. I'm sure the economy will be wobbly after Brent but just as we wouldn't want to stop trading with Europe they wouldn't want to stop trading with us. If they cut off their noses to spite their faces then balls to them anyway.
0/0	I'm 58 (with a mother who was a child in WW2) and well remember fearing my generation would be pulled into a European war because they happened every generation. But now we're three generations in without a major war in Europe and it's the EU that's done it.
0	I'm 63, voted remain, and hate Brexit with every fibre of my being, in large part because of the impact on my children and their families. Not everyone in their 60s is impervious to the effect on younger people.
1/1	I'm American but I agree with brexit.
1	I'm British ... I voted leave ... and I haven't changed my mind!
0/0	I'm British and i'm voting to stay. the EU needs reform but leaving will be like cutting the nose off in spite of the face. if it doesn't reform it's doomed anyway.

My wife is an EU citizen. My livelihood and family life depends on free trade and freedom of movement. Remain.
1/1	I'm French and live in UK and i've always waiting for this moment
0/0	I'm Portuguese and I know the Portuguese Empire was huge a few centuries ago, just like Britain. But we're in 2019! British people need to set aside their "Nationalism" pride and realize that alone, the EU small countries are no match to nowadays superpowers (USA, Russia and China). Not only did the EU keep all countries in peace for decades, it led to a fast development of all EU members. Of course we lose a very small part of our freedom, but imagine if the USA states all separated... 90% of them would become weak and irrelevant in the world's economy. They are strong because they are together, and we need to work together as Europeans in order to thrive!
0/0	I'm Scottish and I voted no. As soon as my country regains its Independence, it will rejoin the EU. Flame away you brexiteer fuckheads.
0/0/0	I'm UK, and I never wanted brexit.
0/-1	I'm a #Remainer who grudgingly voted Lab because LD's are a non entity in Blackpool.
1/1	I'm a 22 year old Brit whose been sitting on the fence for a long time but have recently decided I will be voting to leave. I'm a strong believer in democracy and in my eyes the EU is entirely undemocratic. We can vote for MEPs who can neither suggest new laws nor repeal existing European laws. The real power in Europe lies in the hands of the unelected. 10,000 of the bureaucrats at the EU earn more than our Prime Minister. Whilst I believe there will be short term economic repercussions of leaving, in the long run I hope to be better off. Businesses like stability which is why I think so many support the remain campaign. I don't believe these big multinational companies share the interests of the common man though. A reading of this thread would suggest that the youth vote is firmly with the remain campaign. Amongst my friends (all recent graduates of different degrees from varying social backgrounds) opinion is split. Overall I've been really disappointed by the lack of impartial information on the referendum. It seems to me that neither side has any idea what will really happen if we leave!
1/1/1	I'm a 24 year old male living in the UK and I would like to think I don't fall in to the 'sun reading racist' category, I am however planing on voting to leave. For me it has nothing to do with immigration, it's more to do with the crippling bureaucracy that comes with the EU. The best argument I have heard to remain is 'you can't fix it if you aren't in it' but it seems to me that even with Cameron's best efforts we can't fix it when we are in it. So that being said we have two options, we stay in a union we can't fix or we leave and have a go at fixing our situation on our own.
0/0	I'm a Brit and I want to stay.
1/1	I'm a Corbyn supporter who would vote to leave the EU tomorrow, if I was given the chance, after their meddling in Ukraine, the way they treated Greece.

0/1	I'm a Remainer, a great admirer of Europe's cultural and intellectual heritage and proud of Britain's illustrious place in that story. I love Europe, its beautiful geography, engrossing historical heritage and the company and friendship of its diverse peoples. I'm European tonight and I'll be European tomorrow- as are we all. That is a fact. But a Remainer I may be I am not a Remoaner. Eurosceptics have won a long and difficult battle and for that they get my, ever so slightly grudging, but sincere respect and congratulations. We need to move forward now as a united country and it's beholden on Leavers more than most to make that work; this is your party. I'll do my bit and I genuinely hope that it works out.
1/1	I'm a UK citizen but have lived in Canada for 10 years. I have dual citizenship and never intend on returning to live or work in the UK or Europe. I am on the side of Leave, for one reason. The EU makes a mockery of democracy, I would not want anyone to live in a society where laws are created by those who are unelected, which is exactly what happens in the EU. I agree with EU policies most of the time, however if I did not there would be no recourse. It smacks of a system that is just waiting to be abused. Because of the way I lean on this issue I did not mail-in vote, I think it would be pretty rich for someone who is against people outside of a country telling it how to be run, to then vote in an election in a country I do not live it. I am glad that the conversation regarding the EU is taking place, however the UK has a bad reputation with having hilariously close referendums, and then simply ignoring the issue from then on out. "We've already had a referendum, what more do you want?" Thanks for reading.
1/1	I'm a firm supporter of Brexit, but I'll only believe it when we leave behind all EU laws, we keep our hard earned taxes and we get our waters back. Until then, this is all smoke and mirrors...

1/1	I'm a reluctant for. If we remain in the EU, it will not reform, the reason for this is simple, it's too big to reform. Any reforms take years to actually get to the EU parliament and even then they may not pass. If we vote to leave, it will empower all the other anti-EU or reform EU parties and then finally, the EU will have to listen or lose the entire European project.
0/0	I'm a remainer but I think it's wrong to delay Brexit.
0/0	I'm a remainer who would like a second referendum, however I can see a reasonable argument not to have one
0/1	I'm a year late seeing this. Shame it wasn't obligatory viewing in mid-June 2016. We may have avoided the abortion of Brexit. Tragic.
0	I'm afraid that Leavers became a sect if fanatics completely resistant to the reality and truth. Absolute Teflon.
0/0	I'm afraid that Leavers became a sect of fanatics completely resistant to the reality and truth. Absolute Teflon.
0/0	I'm afraid there are French people now emerging who think Brexit is brilliant, and want to do the same thing in France, just because they don't like Macron. I don't like him either, but I think Brexit is possibly the worst idea in living memory.
1/0/0	I'm afraid they'll just say it's all going to happen on Jan 1st 2021 now. The Apocalypse has merely been postponed
0/0	I'm against Brexit, but the reason is you know, because democracy? You can't just overthrow parliament because you dislike them. Which would also coincidentally lead to actual civil war with the half of the population who voted for Brexit.
0/1	I'm against brexit but a vote is a vote. Brexit was voted and we have to get over it. The day after the vote the discussion should have been how to make brexit better for everyone.
0/0	I'm against the Brexit, for the same reasons I would have been against Scotland leaving the Union. The people who are "for" have not proposed a realistic (or any real) vision of what it would look like
0/0	I'm against us leaving the EU. For many reasons. Mainly because I distrust every politician who says we should leave (and what few politicians I do respect enough to have a modicum of trust for are also against leaving the EU) and I have absolutely no truck with the mainstream media scaremongering. I absolutely do not believe that staying in the EU will lead to a flood of refugees 'invading' our country. I absolutely believe staying in the EU gives us more protections from greedy corporate bastards who don't give a fuck about anything other than their swelling bank balances.
1/1	I'm an American, but I 100% support British freedom from foreign fascism. Hope that a 'big, beautiful' trade deal with the U.S. is soon to follow… Congratulations to the UK…

0/0/0	I'm an ashamed English person. I'm disowning my country

1/1	I'm considered a millennial and everyone I know voted to leave and we would all do it again.
1/1	I'm filled with renewed confidence that Brexit will be a roaring success
1/1	I'm for Brexit despite the fact it's more popular for young people my age to vote remain. I'd first start by saying both campaigns have been atrocious and I think everyone on both sides mutually understands this which is why it's been so hard for some people to make a decision without seeing a balanced argument. The reasons I have for voting Brexit are: We don't have full control of our own laws and quite frankly the EU is not democratic. We cannot remove any of these ridiculous 5 presidents they have in the EU making laws which govern us, which is a serious flaw. Part of democracy is being able to hold our officials accountable and remove them from power. Remain does acknowledge this but argues that we should stay in to still have a seat at the negotiating table so to speak, well we only have 13% of the vote and as more countries join the EU we lose influence. Quite frankly the other countries will vote for what benefits them most which for much of the EU that is poorer it is usually not in our best interests.I mentioned more countries joining the EU, and that's an issue. Turkey is on the fast track to joining the EU, and as far as I'm concerned this poses a threat to the UK. Turkey has supposedly got flawed border security and there's been lots of reports of buying ISIS oil etc and in general supporting them, regardless of that fact if you look at /r/worldnews it gets saturated with the shit Erdogan does. Having Turkey join means free movement into the UK which I don't want.Remain says we'll plunge into recession leaving and most financial institutes agree with this. Well no shit, who'd have thought dissolving our EU membership and trade deals would have an impact on our economy? Of course it will but let's be honest people are self interested and the UK is the 5th largest economy currently. So many other countries will want to trade with us because it's beneficial to them. If you look at some of the people who endorse remain/leave you'll see they mostly have business interests either in the EU or outside it which financially motivates their vote. In addition, Europe is a stagnating economy; It has the slowest rate of economic growth over any other continent. I believe in the long term with new trade deals in Asia/South America we'd be better off in the long run but we would have a period of recession first.The NHS is quite the political football at the moment. On the one hand the migrants who come here do the NHS a great service and are the backbone of our healthcare system. I'd be concerned with losing many of them but I would expect we will focus on allowing in skilled migrants to work in the NHS and also encouraging more Brits to enter into healthcare, albeit hard to do with the Jeremy Cunt fiasco. So I have faith we'd be able to populate it with enough workers. By leaving I hope we'd be able to both membership fee money on the NHS and also avoid being forced into TTIP.Immigration needs to be controlled. If we maintain unstable rates of growth it puts too much pressure on public services as well as things we also have issues with at the moment, like housing. Additionally the current free movement is biased against the rest of the world. Any unskilled worker from the EU can come to the UK over say a skilled engineer from Korea or Japan. It's said a lot but we do need a points based immigration system like Australia. A lot of the lefties jump at calling it racist or saying we have a humanitarian duty to take in more people but quite frankly it isn't racist it's common sense, and I agree we should help people as much as we can but if you look at the European immigration crisis the vast majority of people who have come to EU countries are economic migrants who aren't from Syria, they're from northern Africa or elsewhere in the Middle East. I feel we should focus on fixing problems in our country first before helping other people. I'll leave this for now because It's reaching the point where I'm ranting about problems but these should give an idea of the way I'm thinking. For the most part I avoided using facts/figures because quite frankly they get thrown around all over the place and no one really knows what's going on.
1/0	I'm for open globalism, not narrow regionalism.
0/0	I'm for remain, but I live in the US (yes, am a brit). I like the premise of Europe cooperating on things, and having collective bargaining and rights. For example, I'd like to be able to go and work in Germany without having to get a work permit. I think the Remain camp should have had a bigger strategy. For example "We will find allies towards a progressive dismantlement of Brussels and Strasbourg. Elected and appointed officials will come home and do all business with distant colleagues by video conferencing, thus ending the expenses gravy-train". Sure, they'd need an industrial strength video conferencing solution, and would have to have a moderator to prevent the all-speak-at-once problem, but I think Google and Microsoft would compete to supply that for free. Westminster could benefit from the same perhaps too.
1/1	I'm french and happy for Great Britain. I hope that there will be a Frexit one day.

0/0/0	I'm from the UK. I don't think we should leave. I think we should try and make the EU better. Instead if just abandoning it.
1/1	I'm generally fine with it. The EU is a very different beast than it was when the UK started, and maintaining national sovereignty is a worthwhile goal.

1/-1	I'm going to have your back no matter which way you decide to go with this. I understand the justification for it, but maybe the short-term pain isn't worth the long term gain? Maybe it is? Maybe it's overstated anyway? I don't know. Whatever you do about this I'll be a fan of your country.

0/0	I'm having a very "lively" dialog with several British friends through social media regarding Brexit, and the mood is clear: an atmosphere of pure fantasy has gripped a sizeable number of people.
0/0	I'm heartbroken. A deeply sad day, which historians shall cite as the extraordinary moment a minority of a population "won" the right to strip their children of their own future. Baffling.

0/0	I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
1/-1	I'm hoping for economic integration and maybe a resumption of the free movement of people
0/0	I'm hugely upset about Brexit. I think the EU is a beacon of light in a dangerous world, and the UK government have decided to leave under dubious circumstances

1/1	I'm just glad we're out of that french dictatorship
0/0	I'm just worried that as a resident, the standard of living will go down, prices will go up, I'm worried about the economy, etc.
0/0	I'm late to the thread but in case another opinion is still useful to you... I'm a non-EU migrant to the Netherlands and was living in England in 2016 when the referendum results were announced. It was baffling to me - after the thousands of Euro and all the beauracratic hoops I had to jump through to obtain a residency permit, here is an entire European nation DELIBERATELY throwing away its people's EU citizenship rights! Genuinely made me wonder how many voters had lived as non-EU citizens (i.e. been adults pre mid-70s) and if they had any idea that they could even vote for their MEP (as I can not without citizenship) let alone ever lobbied their MEP to make the changes they would like to see in the EU. While I m aware of the flaws in the EU (the Eurozone is pretty questionable, and large chunks of the EU budget are often squandered) the principle is sound and the simple bliss of living in peace time cannot be easily dismissed. My heart goes out to the destitute poor and working poor of the UK, it's been an ugly decade and will only get worse.
0/0	I'm laughing so hard at the comments about Britain being British again. LMAO have you seen London? All that new money comes from Nigeria, the Middle-east, Russia and China. Britain needs that money to sustain a healthy economy but yet they want to see immigrants as pests. Well congrats to you all. I'm curious what this is going to look like.

1/1	I'm no political genius but surely there must be more advantages to leaving than remaining, I voted leave but I just cannot understand why there is such an outcry to remain, can someone explain to me why
0/-1	I'm not Anglo, cuz I'm not from Los Angeles, but Why are British ppl fleeing the continent? Is Europe that bad? Where is Britain gonna move to? Arkansas?
1/1/1	I'm not English but I support the U.K.'s desire to leave the E.U. because liberal policies screw countries
1/1	I'm not a baby boomer and I voted for Brexit. I find it quite disheartening to see how twisted the reasons for Brexit have become that people believe that leave voters chose to do so based out of spite.
0/-1	I'm not a smart person, I've tried to stay abreast of this entire thing, but some things slip through my understanding, but I have to wonder doesn't the EU hold all the cards in this? What do we have to use as a bargaining tool?
1/1	I'm not angry im really happy that the EU want's a no deal brexit. That's what we voted for!!!
0/0	I'm not bitter and I accept #Brexit is happening but withdrawing from frictionless trade with our neighbouring market of 500M people is an act of blatant, jaw-dropping stupidity and I'm not going to stop saying so now.
1/1	I'm not doing this for the UK. I'm doing this for ALL europeans.
0/0	I'm not entirely sure you're going to be able to negotiate a better deal. UK will lose 45% of export, and quite a bit of import from the EU. If the EU will deny trade with the UK, the UK would jump down a massive economic black hole. The entire economic viability depends on the willingness of the EU to continue trading after the Brexit. If that's not on the table, the UK will have to be damn sure it can replace all it's EU import and export, by making new trade agreements with its biggest suppliers and consumers of goods. But they'd be doing this at a severe disadvantage. Some people will say you can use Switzerlands model, or Norways model, but there is no evidence supporting that the EU will allow this. Neither countries were ever in the EU. For the EU it was a win-win situation, and maybe they'll join the EU later on. Trade with the UK after Brexit would still be beneficial for Europe, but it depends on how much the EU would want to make a statement about a member leaving. Europe could economically survive the Brexit (it would still sting for members states), it's difficult to say if the UK would survive it too, if trade with the EU would stop. Losing a tiny bit of export/import is do-able, but 45% of export? I'm not so sure. I don't even understand how you can consider the possibility of a Brexit till you can address the severe economic uncertainty and can guarantee that the Brexit isn't also an economical exit.
1/1	I'm not from Britain but I agree with the result. You have to cut off from the nipple at some point and it's going to be hard. There will be struggles and trying times but in the end everyone in Britain will reap the benefits. We as Americans struggled for awhile after leaving the British but we became the most powerful country in the world(maybe not so much anymore!). I believe Britain will become a powerhouse after cutting ties to all the countries feeding off them like leeches.
0/0/0	I'm not going to cry if companies leave the UK because they can't afford to pay British people livable wages. Not everyone wants to live 6 to a 1 bed flat

0/0	I'm not going to mourn #BrexitDay, nor celebrate. I'm feeling defiant & determined, so will be wearing the boots which I created for the anti-Brexit protests!
1/1	I'm not going to vote, since I'm a Belgian citizen. I'm a Bruxiter, which is to mean that I want to get rid of the EU. And Brexit is an important step on that way. I follow the news of several countries but mainly France, the UK, Belgium, Italy, Germany, etc... and I follow several country subreddits and one thing has struck me: it's like everyone is totally disconnected from what is happening elsewhere. It's like everyone is staring at their own navel and not seeing what's happening in the other EU member countries. When you make the effort to look at the bigger picture, to connect the dots so to speak, I don't understand for the life of me why you would want to stay in the EU. Didn't you see how the EU bullied Greece and is now bullying Italy? Don't you ever read about the German debate about the Euro? Don't you see how impopular Macron has become? Don't you know there have been two referendums in the Netherlands, one concerning the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 and more recently one on the association agreement between the EU and the Ukraine, twice the Dutch voted no, twice their political class wiped their asses with the result? I mean, when you look at the bigger picture, how can you not conclude that what's happening now in the UK is the exact same scenario that has been played over and over again in Europe the past 30 years? But maybe that's exactly the problem, you don't look at the bigger picture.
1/1	I'm not interested in seeing EU fail. I'm just not interested in Britain being a part of it any more.
0/0/0	I'm not just a Remainer. I'm a European through and through, and the rats have taken over the ship.
0/0	I'm not pro-Brexit, if that's what you mean
1/1	I'm not saying businesses are bad, we NEED businesses and traid. I just don't want BP passing legislations for us. The UK used to produce a lot of stuff so we exported loads, now we import more then we sell. Outside the EU, we'd have better trading prospects, It won't be free traid, But there will be more options.
0/0	I'm not saying that everyone who voted for Brexit is stupid.... but every stupid person did vote for Brexit.
0/0	I'm not so sure they are. Sure, there will be some of those in there, but I think for many people, they have no idea of or care for how the country's finances work, where the money comes from that pays for their beloved NHS, police, defence etc - they just think it grows on a tree and/or "the rich" will pay. Hence labour's appeal.
1/1	I'm not white, and I'm 19. I voted leave. It's not about remembering tyranny. It's about appreciating freedom.
1/1/1	I'm often too afraid to publicly voice my view and stance on the referendum. I'm a young person of an ethnic minority (I'm Asian), born and raised in Britain, learning 3 European (2 of them are Slavic) languages, yet I'd still be regarded as a racist because I'm voting leave. It's silly that people instantly assume that if someone's voting leave, they're a racist.
0/1	I'm one of the 2 million UK citizens who live and work outside the country thanks to EU membership. Free movement and trade is so important for the future of country. So many people in the UK who have not lived or worked in any other EU country have no idea what the benefits are. It goes 2 ways. There are so many opportunities outside the UK - it would be a shame if our wonderful country left the EU.
0/0	I'm one of those weirdos who believes that the recent wave of immigration and our membership of the EU have been wholly beneficial to the UK. I'm even more weird in knowing that official data backs me up.
1/1	I'm only 26 so I'm not like the vast majority of those my age who voted remain but like you, I've lived all over. UK obviously, USA, UAE, China, Africa. I voted leave for the EXACT reasons you listed. There are so many more opportunities for us as a country out there and I want us to be in the best position to capitalise on these. Reading reddit abd watching the news these past 48 hours has made my blood boil. Yes I can understand people are frustrated by the result but fucking hell not everyone who voted leave is a racist, uneducated, economically illiterate bastard. There are a multitude of reasons to vote for one or the other side and now that the decision has been made we should all just move on together and make the best out of the have we've been dealt.
0/0	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay
0/0	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay but of course Westminster just ignored our votes completely
0/0	I'm pretty sure everyone in the union is getting their services etc at a much cheaper rate than compared to other countries who have to maintain their own agencies for those services. So in a sense we are all getting more out if than if we were to go at it solo. That is all that matters in the end. You have to provide those services anyways. It's hard to put all this in numbers to show what the actual return is so it often gets overlooked I feel.

0/-1	I'm really sad to say it , but you really played yourselves, in the most fantastic way. Not even a sci-fi writer could think something like this
0/0	I'm rooting for a no deal brexit because I believe that uninformed, stupid voting must be punished.
1/0	I'm sad by Brexit like Spanish, but I can understand Britons: pay EU budget for the South Europeans countries and also receive massive immigration: Is not a good issue. EU were not good formed:the buildings begin at bottom, not at the top. Farewell.
0	I'm sad to watch the UK self destruct, and sad that there's nothing we can do to help. You're free to seek oblivion in your own way, but you're not going to drag us down with you. Call us in 20 years if you come to your senses, fix your political system, and decide you really want to be on board. Otherwise don't waste any more of our precious time.
0/0	I'm scared were going to actually end up out of the EU... do people actually understand what will happen if we leave?

1/1	I'm sick of Anti-brexit articles being pushed by the Biased Broadcasting Corporation at every opportunity.
1/1	I'm sick of remainers. I initially voted remain (Only to avoid a higher cost of living, even if it's only for a few years) but I respect democracy and I now want to leave. No matter the margin, whether it's 1 vote or 3 million. The EU is corrupt and we need to leave for our independence. Tyranny shall lose. We can survive, albeit with short term extreme difficulty. Big riots will happen if not.

1/1	I'm so proud of my fellow Britons. We voted to get our country back but will we? It's now a waiting game to see when Article 50 is triggered, soon hopefully. I've got no regrets about voting 'Out' and will do again if they try to stitch is up.

1/1	I'm sorry but the EU is no longer just 6 countries as they said here. There are 27 countres, but the main 6 or even main 2 (Germany and France) are behaving like the rest of the EU is their property. If this will still be as it is now there will be more quits from EU.
0/0	I'm starting to believe the best thing would be for UKIP to get in at the next election , we leave the EU and the bastards that voted for them can reap the rewards, more unemployment, more disenfranchisemnet, more poverty and a meaner, sadder England (Scotland having voted to go independent).
1/1	I'm starting to think a 'Brexit' is a good idea and I never thought I'd ever say that.
0/0	I'm still European in my heart! I'm sad but I accept it because I have no other choice, but I will never be a British nationalist, I live in England and was raised in wales, Europe funded much of what gave me life and support, so it's in my life blood.
0/0	I'm still raging. I see us a Northern European country, with many common connections across the North Sea. I feel like I've had people and things I believed in torn away from me. I was always pro-Yes, and genuinely believed that the best future for Scotland was one where the people of Scotland who lived and worked here were ones who made the decisions about the future of our nation. Brexit has only solidified my view that Scotland should be an independent, *European* nation. tl;dr: fuck Brexit.
0/0	I'm stockpilling. I don't trust this government, they've been quite incompetent so far.
1/1	I'm strongly for Leave as are most of the people I know, both offline and online. I've seen mainly Leave posters in my area (near London) and I get a sense that we are in the majority, even despite the absolutely shameful tactics of the Remain campaign and their allies. The argument is a simple one for me: it is about sovereignty. It is about liberty. It is about democracy. It is not about trinkets and baubles. The EU is anti-democratic, founded in the egregious civil law (say goodbye to due process, presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, jury trials, etc), has no concept of the rule of law, believe themselves above the law, and is ruining Europe economically. National sovereignty is hard to come by and even harder to keep. We have not fought and bled over centuries to defend it just to hand it on a plate to the EU. The planners and collaborators of this European Project have used stealth and deceit to bring us to this point. Why, if something be so good, would such methods be used? Think about that. My concern is that many young people - having been fed a pro-EU agenda through EU-funded British education institutions - no longer understand what sovereignty is and why it is important. They have been sold the lie of internationalism and, being ignorant of the lessons of history, may not realise their folly until it is too late.
1/1/1	I'm sure it will be fine in the end

1/-1	I'm surprised the sky hasn't fallen in this morning followed by flooding , pestilence and plague , perhaps brexit won't be that bad after all .
0/1	I'm trying to be positive, maybe we need the bad to appreciate the good, maybe this country needs to experience life outside of the EU to vanquish these ridiculous illusions of grandeur. We will rejoin the EU stronger and more committed.
0/0/0	I'm very worried for our country. Johnson's Brexit plans are very extreme & he may even secretly want a catastrophic No Deal Brexit, which he will blame on the EU!
0/0	I'm voting IN, because the UK can't fight climate change on its own. Why are you IN? #strongerin #eureferendum
1/1	I'm voting Leave as I don't think 6 unelected people in Brussels should be able to dictate the laws of our country.
1/1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry
1/1/1/1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry.
1/1	I'm voting Leave to restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy. Any other arguments - whether for or against - are immaterial.
1/1	I'm voting Leave. I have campaigned for it and have appeared on the BBC as an invited panellist for sunday politics. I'm also a uni student up north. Why Leave? well, if this were a simple economic question i'd be remain. If the commission was really under the agenda set by our elected governments with oversight by a truly 'proportional' EP and council of ministers who did have genuine authority and power then I might be tempted to put up with it. But as it is, and as it looks like it is going, there are issues concerning the question of who governs? As long as it remains the fact that we have a situation where parliament is not the ultimate authority in regards to the laws by which we live then Leaving is justified regardless. There are plenty of examples of how the current, past and probable future behaviour and conduct of the various arms and institutions of the EU project. In 2009 the European Council - the heads of the elected governments (later excusing Mario Monti and Italy) - asked the Commission to consider internal austerity, i.e. cutting their own wages given the member states were themselves under fiscal pressure, the Commissioners (surprise surprise) didn't like this suggestion and took the Council to the ECJ. The ECJ found in favour of the commission, given the fact that if the wages of the commission were to come under scrutiny then logically the wages of other EU and Brussels-related institutions would be next. Powell and the Spectator were right in 1975 when they said (and even as Heath would admit) the future of the EEC was political. We keep being told about the uncertainty of Leaving, and I agree there will be huge challenges, but the future of the EU in uncertain and the EZ more so.
1/1	I'm voting OUT. Europe is full of weak, poor and struggling countries. How can joining them be a good thing for us? I wish it were just France, Germany and UK in EU, now that would be a decent alliance and I'd be in.
1	I'm voting leave. As I see it my civil liberties are undemocratically fucked two fold currently, I have the EU passing legislation I cannot refute and I have HM Civil Service passing legislation I cannot refute, I'd rather decrease the authoritative powers that be into a smaller cluster, rather than creating Yugoslavia 2.0. Am I frightened of the consequences of giving complete control to the fucktards that govern Britain? Yes I am. Am I worried about initial repercussions to the economy? Yes I am. But as it stands, what do we aspire to become within the EU? Other countries like Switzerland and Norway have a GDP twice as high. Perhaps I'm being optimistic but Britain has a trade surplus in almost every service sector except tourism, we have the ability to do well outside of the EU and smash the glass ceiling that is the EU trading bloc. We have the potential, we are the world’s fifth largest economy and fourth largest military power. One of only five countries with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The WTO has driven down trade tariffs and we'll be afforded the opportunity to import far cheaper without European trade quotas cock blocking us and gain far more access to international markets. In regards to immigration, it's not something the fearmongers have frightened me with, but I CAN see it pragmatically. The housing crisis (mostly private but some social) is unable to sustain the type of numbers we are receiving now without an influx from newly registered EU countries. I'm by no means a British nationalist, I just think we can emulate other non EU European countries to increase our standard of living.
0/0	I'm voting remain none of the leave campaign arguments have convinced me to change my mind. One of the biggest arguments my leave friends have been throwing around is how the EU is undemocratic and how they can vote on what laws to pass and we don't get a say but I don't understand how that's any different from Scottish, Irish and Welsh MPS getting to vote on English matters (like the tuition fee increase) because we don't have our own devolved parliament yet we don't get a say in what happens in their countries. No one's able to tell me what will happen if we leave because no one knows, "facts" they've been throwing around have been proven to be false so it doesn't make their argument look credible. Honestly at this stage I just can't wait till its over I'm sick of both sides and I'm sick of a lot of people getting wound up over it. Just because it's a referendum doesn't mean parliament actually has to do it, hell remain could win but we could still leave and vice versa. I just want to get back to normal life without this and the American election been shoved down our throats every day.
0/0	I'm voting remain. I've lived in Mainland Europe and my parents and grandparents both worked there for a time and I believe staying in will be stronger for the country than going alone. However I feel I can't state this opinion to the general population because I'll be told I'm foolish and too young to understand the real issues of the world. I've been fed up with the campaigning from both sides for months and months I want us all to chill the fuck out and move on. Except we won't. Whatever we decide this week will cause a shit storm in Westminster and we'll have a general election by Christmas when all the shit will start to again. I vote because it's my right, I vote because it's important and I vote because I care.
0/0/0/0/0	I'm voting remain. the EU is a known system, leaving is a risk we don't need to take. Plus I like being part of a larger system, unlike some of my countrymen I don't view the UK as some islands far away from europe. Plus in my more naive moments I like to imagine that this sort of large union could lead to the utopian future I read in sci-fi novels as a kid.
1/1	I'm voting to leave although neither side has really left me with sufficient information to make an informed decision. I'm really curious to see what would happen if we do leave and see which side is right. The main reason why I want to leave is because we're actually having a referendum. If leaving was actually going to leave us in the financial turmoil that the remain campaign is saying that we will have if we leave then we wouldn't be having a referendum in the 1st place. David Cameron keeps saying that we can do this and that in the EU and that we have influence. Then why was he laughed at when he tried to negotiate a better deal for us within the EU? If that's how the EU reacted when we threatened to leave then what makes him think that if we remain with them they'll suddenly give us what we want? Barely anyone from the EU has even bothered to give their 2 cents or ask us to stay which is weird because we put in a lot of money to the EU and we take in a lot of migrants, they should care but most of them haven't shown that they do. The leave campaign aren't perfect either but at least they're trying to fix the problems that we have in this country. I hate almost all of the leading figures for both sides but when watching the debates I agree with a hell of a lot more points that the leave campaign says than the remain campaign.
1/1	I'm voting to leave. As a 28 year old, under-paid, over-educated northerner, I have absolutely nothing lose. I would probably fare better, and even find more satisfaction in, scrapping for tins of beans on the street after the power goes off than continuing under the present circumstances.
1/1	I'm voting to leave. The Eurozone is ready to implode and we would be best off distancing ourselves from the fallout. Remember the shit show about Greece defaulting on their debts? When Italy or Spain defaults(as they are likely to do) it will be a different story. In addition, I'm a believer in small government. The further away from the common man our leaders are, the more complacent they will become. Getting rid of the EU seems a good way to even the odds
0/0	I'm voting to remain because what they have done to are fishing industry...Oh and for mobile roaming charges
0/0	I'm voting to remain.
0/0	I'm voting to remain. Kyle doesn't seem to be aware of the racist propaganda the leave side have used to stir up hatred and touch the hearts of far right Nazi's.
0/0	I'm voting to stay in the EU. These heroes you list. They're all from a different era. If you compare modern Britain to the Britain they lived in we are have fallen behind. We don't have any innovators. All we have are idiots like Cameron and Farrage and Co. Those heroes had a high degree of selflessness and humanity, which is lacking in today's leaders. Churchill and the rest weren't perfect, but their like have gone and won't be seen again. People who think we are still like those heroes are living in a fantasy world.
1/1	I'm with a Free Britain. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1/1	I'm with the out group we spend to much money on the EU and why should we be dictated to by Germany we won the war and they are now telling us what to do and we do not want any more immigrants here we can't cope with what we have and our NHS is crumbling because it's being abused I Want Out
1/1	I'm with them, but think we are headed for no Brexit and some real anger from the 17.4-million, it's a stitch up, the greatest betrayal of all time.
0/0	I'm wondering what many Leavers think abt this now, especially since a lot more info abt the real consequences is out. Oh, also, since the rich Leavers have been taking their business elsewhere etc
0/-1	I'm wondering whether I should give up and not give a crap about my fellow Brits, on the basis that if they won't help themselves, why should I invest myself. But there are a lot of people who need help and didn't ask for this.
0/0	I'm worried about the prospect of a Micheal Gove, Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith, Daniel Hannan and possibly Nigel Farage government being elected if we leave. That would be a disaster of epic proportions!
1/1/1	I'm worried that 'crime is easier to deal with' ignores the fact the EU has made crime easier in the first place (the terrorists atrocities for example)
0/0	I've already had the most precious of gifts from Brexit - realising my parents are racists. They kept it hidden for a long time but thanks to Brexit, it's been pulled out into the sun. They alienated almost all of their kids and grandkids with their political rants on Facebook, it's been really hard to deal with. You think that someone is kind, generous and fair but then it turns out that it only applies to British people, preferably not Irish, and definitely not Romanians or Poles. Thanks Brexit!
0/0	I've always voted labour and I'm an ex trade union official but I will never vote labour again unless they try and stop brexit.
0/0	I've been asking those people I know who voted for Brexit almost every day now for the last three years, to give me just one practical example of how their every day lives will be better as a result. I'm still listening to their silence.
1/1	I've been clear that Brexit means Brexit.
0/0	I've been feeling rather ashamed of my own country for quite some time now
1/1	I've been wondering why UK is a member of EU for a long time.
1/1	I've come to the conclusion that despite all the evidence to the contrary that Britain will be a country to be proud of once again, remainers will continue in this vein because they are followers, never leaders. They are suspicious of anyone who is successful and optimistic. Their misery prevails as it doesn't entail any effort on their part. The continual same old comments show a repeated mantra as they can only copy each other.
0/0	I've from UK and just voted to remain today and to say thank you TYT support.
0/0	I've got one they can have for free: #StopBrexit.
1/-1	I've got to see the Brexit process through. we won the war, but we must win the peace.
0/0	I've had my Europeaness taken away
1/1	I've just never been prouder of my country... Brexit day is about celebrating not just Brexit it's about celebrating democracy. It's alive and well and kicking in Britain.
1/1	I've lived my early life in a Communist country, a former Soviet republic and I notice a hell of a lot of parallels with the EU today. The EU seems to think that modern communism is the answer. Taking money from "rich" countries and redistributing it to the "poor" countries. I for one do not relish the idea of paying for poor Romanians (yes I'm evil I hate moochers, I don't care if they're poor I don't want my money going to help them I want it to help my own countrymen), or the billions that Poland gets (incidentally Poland is not a poor country yet receives shit-tons of money from the EU for some reason despite having better infrastructure than most member states) and then you have to accept foreign workers that work for less money and put you out of a job (yeah don't tell me it doesn't happen or that we don't want dem jobs etc). The USSR was one giant country. The EU is quite close to that definition and the way that some people in here and /r/europe talk it seems they want this as well. They want to erase their national identity. They want their money taken from them and handed over to French farmers who don't do anything, or to make Poland better while other member states roads and infrastructure crumble due to lack of investment. Why does anyone want a federal state? Why does anyone want to erase national identity? Why does anyone want to take on millions of economic migrants (yes, they aren't refugees - [even the EU said so] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-out-of-10-migrants-to-europe-come-for-economic-reasons-and-are-not-refugees-eu-vice-president-a6836306.html) so please explain pro-eu people why you want this ? Why do you want a federal state ? do you think it would be better than your own government ? Why do you want a drunk as your leader? Who spends thousands on expensive wines and slaps people in the face while he's drunk ? Why do you want your wealth redistributed to supposedly "poor" countries? Why do you want everyone to use the same dodgy currency that constantly needs bailing out ? Why do you want protectionism that means you end up paying more for stuff just so a bunch of Germans get to keep selling you appliances that break down in 2 years? I'm proud to now be a British citizen, and I'm proud to be a brexiter as well. I have three degrees and I'm not stupid and I'm not racist or xenophobic either. Why must remainers label everyone as such ? It's a straw man right ? I don't get it.
0/0	I've never felt so useless or ashamed or saddened by the nation in which I was born. I am a citizen of the EU and I am about to be stripped of that citizenship against my will.
0	I've never seen or met a brexiteer that doesn't seem... off..
0/0	I've never seen so many people celebrating the loss of privileges.
0/1	I've never understood why the UK would join the EU in the first place. It is like after fighting France, Germany, Spain and others for centuries, the UK surrendered a big chunk of their sovereignty to them without firing a shot.
1/-1/0	I've now I unfollowed @BBCNews and @SkyNews and cancelled my licence fee. Disgraceful from a national, state funded broadcaster. The sooner Boris stops the licence tax the better.
1/1	I've said it before and I'll say it again! The EU are scared to death of us leaving them and that's why they're being such a pain. Get up, walk out and loads of other countries will then follow. They haven't got the bottle to do it themselves but will do it after we've done all the hard work. About time you got tough TM but at last you are doing something!
0/0	I've said it since the vote in 2016 I believe Brexit will lead to the break up of Britain Scotland and northern Ireland will leave Britain and I don't see Brexit ending well for anyone but its democracy so we need to except the vote and move forward I hope Brexit works out but I don't think it will unfortunately.
0	I've seen how the EU tackles tax evasion versus the US – and if Brexit Britain follows Trump, we're headed for disaster
0/0	I've spoken to a hell of a lot of Brexit supporters and have yet to hear a single well thought out and reasonable argument about the benefits of leaving the EU. So far I have seen only ignorance, arrogance or bigotry from them. What we're going to lose and the struggle we'll all now face with higher taxes, fewer job opportunities, expensive holidays and inevitable increases to the cost of living, are not worth the risk. We've just sold our democracy to the Tories, who were already on their way to destroying it and now can complete their task.
0/0	I've talked to my SO's family from the UK (he immigrated as a child and most of his family still lives there). They have all stated they are incredibly worried about the economic impact that leaving the EU would have.
0/0	I've voting remain. Yes europe is a clusterfuck but the problems it has can be solved, and the problems we will get if we leave will not be. I have real issues with Brussels, but the good outweighs the bad. Also i hate this whole fucking immigration scare tactic. Even if i was super anti-immigration, the whole syrian refugee flood is a bullshit scare tactic. Do people forget we have the channel anyway? Also we guard the french side of the border in a special deal we have with them. We could lose that anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if immigration become WORSE by leaving. And if you worry about EU immigration? Well i guess the 2 million+ UK citizens leaving in spain and france better head home then.
1/1	I've waited 47 years for this event, BRING IT ON! :-)
0/0	I've yet to hear a valid reason from the Brexit side for us leaving the EU. All their arguments are rooted in Xenophobia, Racism and "Little eNglander"attitudes. It would absolute folly to leave..renegotiate yes...leave no.
0/0	I+B69 can't believe the idiocy of this argument, that recession, slow growth, ineffective monetary policy and beaten down banks have been around for so long that they could not have anything to do with Brexit. You are like a doctor saying to the heart attack patient that your heart block is not because of your heart attack, because both heart attacks and cholesterol in your arteries have been around for a long time. The logic is so stupid I cannot find words to express the sheer ignorance of it. THE ECONOMY IS CYCLICAL, PROBLEMS GET BETTER AND WORSE ACCORDING TO ECONOMIC DECISIONS AND BEHAVIOUR. WHAT IS IN QUESTION WITH BREXIT IS CAUSATION OF THE SINGLE INSTANCE OR TREND RELATED TO THESE ISSUES AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.
0/1	I,have to stay.my ancestry is more British than most English but I love this country,one day it will get better.

0/0	IF an idea of single entity having much better position on international market is "fine"', then we should reform the EU (something that many countries call for). I don't see how that argument works for leaving EU completely

0/0	Idea: Introduce a referendum to get rid of Brexit
0/0	Ideally MEPs should vote against this as the British people haven't yet had a free fair,safe,legitimate Referendum on whether to Remain in or Leave the EU!The EU Referendum in 2016 was very close, extremely corrupted, unsafe and illegitimate & we shouldn't be leaving the EU on the basis of that corrupted vote! Vote Leave and Leave.EU broke our Laws including huge overspending in regulated period!
0/0	Idiocracy is ensuing. People who knew jackshit about the complexity of how the world runs were given a say in the matters they knew nothing about. Moreover, they will label anyone who's trying to feed information to their empty heads as having an agenda. Direct democracy is a form of mob rule where the mob will do everything which "feels" right rather than what the reality at hand indicates.

0/0	If Brexit happens, it will be a disaster.
0/0	If Brexit is not carried out only people who believe immigration causes all our problems and rich unaffected by Brexit people should riot, good honest caring people would be celebrating if we remain.

0/0	If Brexit is so great, how come *all those* billionaires who bankrolled it aren't doing it?
1/1	If Brexit means an extra £10-12 a month on my £100 shopping bill, it's worth it as long as we get out of Europe. They don't care about us.

1/1	If Brit has to choose between EU and an active volcano, it sould choose active volcano. EU is pure sh**
0/-1	If Britain leaves it would have a rippling effect across Europe, especially to major trade partners such as Ireland and France. It would damage the credibility of the EU as an ideology and as a functioning judicial body.
0/0	If Britain leaves the EU then Scotland should do another referundum on leaving Britain
0/0	If Britain leaves the EU, it will sink like an anchor. Because of borders, Northern Ireland will likely vote to leave the UK and rejoin Ireland, Scotland may vote again to leave the UK too and rejoin the EU.
1/0	If Britain leaves the European Union, then it will make Europe more solitary and confined and will begin a domino effect where one EU member leaves an another states leave too. This will bring Europe back to World War I. In addition Europe won't be the same again, but the benefit are that. Since Turkey want to join the EU. Now they can't, this mean a revival of the native European culture and identity. Leading to the end of Multi-cultural ism and deportation of immigrant and migrants.
1/1	If Britain leaving weakens the German Empire, then Russia is pleased. But that is not a bad thing - the German Empire antagonising Russia is dangerous and perhaps an internally weak EU would be less aggressive. Either way, it would be better for us to not be entangled in such things.

The only way for those of us who remember life outside the EU to show you, is for the millions who dont know to vote to leave! Go for it. Theres no way back. And as many of us have been saying, with a certain amount of inside 'info', EU businesses employing UK citizens WILL relocate. Hundreds of thousands of jobs lost. Do this referendum soon. Then Cameron will have to shoulder the mess. Along with us.

0/0/0/0	If England wanted a say to what happens in Europe they lost it now. Like Oliver's point here, if they hate the EU they'd be better off having a seat at the EU decision maker's table and not leaving all of Europe to be decided by the French and the Germans. They'd be fools to think what happens in Europe won't effect them in Britian.

0/0	If I vote remain tomorrow, and Britain stays in an increasingly authoritarian EU, I can just about live with myself. If I vote leave tomorrow, and Britain becomes even more of a Tory dystopia without the EU, I don’t think I can live with myself. So, for that reason, I’m sticking with remain.
1/1	If I wasn't a Brexiteer before watching #InsideEurope I would be after watching it. Without exception, the EU leaders come across as arrogant, bullying, and scornful of Britain.
1/-1	If I were Boris I wouldn’t give a penny to EU end of story.
1/1	If I were a British citizen I would vote to leave. The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.

0/1	If anyone is dreaming, it is you. The UK economy is about 1/7th of the EU. EU exports to the UK are 10% of the total (but nearly 50% of the UK's total exports). Regardless of the outcome, this won't disappear, but perhaps diminish, let's say to 5% in the worst case scenario. It is safe to say that the EU will be quite able to take a hit of 5%, whereas the UK will struggle to take a 25% hit to its exports. Moreover, the UK's main export is services which won't be covered by any FTA; the EU mainly exports goods, which will be covered. Yet again, you show the utter ignorance of brexiters in all matters of economi
1	If anyone thinks this is a bad thing just know that police are beating firefighters in the streets of "Ol' Pierrie" right now. Total media blackout on major news channels on where the EU is going.
0/0	If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy
0/0	If every single Remainer in London could spare 15 minutes outside parliament with us it would be formidable! #NoBrexit #RevokeA50 let's be sensible and not destroy our country #Remain!
0/0	If everyone spoke the truth and listend to i. Then things would have been different. Worst thing in brexit is the murder of a politician and a journalist.
1/1	If feels like working for a horrible boss and being giving the opportunity to go self employed...you’d be scared at first but an amazing chance to be happy and more successful
0/0	If folks would stop marrying their cousins perhaps things like Brexit would not happen in Britain and elsewhere. Now that they have thought about it a little bit, why not hold a special vote asking if everyone is sure they want to exit the EU?
0/-1	If he is the British representative then I’m sure the EU will be happy for UK to leave. I’m confident he does not speak, or act for a majority of British people.
1/1	If in doubt, vote out
0/0	If intelligent people with experience and insight are to be believed GDP, National Debt, Poverty, Zero Hours Contracts, Employment Rights, Unemployment (the real sort, not the comedy figures BloJo proports) are going to get a lot worse over the next few years. Still, at least we got blue passports and have enough control that we can only blame ourselves for the forthcoming clusterfuck. Unless it's all the EU's fault, like before.
0/0	If it ain't broke don't Brexit.
1/1	If it does nothing else, this encapsulates all the reasons why we must leave on March 29th. A more malign and malevolent group of European  bureaucrats  would be very hard to imagine. Beyond our departure date, how will any British negotiator be able to view such people with anything other than extreme revulsion.
1	If it doesn't go well I'll hold my hands up and say I overestimated the power of the UK, but I still genuinely believe we are large enough and influential enough for this to be the success that it could be
1/0	If it is true then the British government should not allow them to come back when the EU collapses but I doubt any successful company would want to join a sinking ship!!!!
1/1	If it means we can go back to using decent lightbulbs and choose high-powered hairdryers and vacuum cleaners if we so wish, I'm joining Brexit for sure
0/1	If it was an anti Brexit party it would have been reported as millions. The media have been the true protagonist, for over 3 years they have been setting remainer against leaver with their completely fabricated or subjective fake news...time they were called out on their BS.
1/-1	If it was so great they wouldn't be leaving, the rest of them are so jelous
0/0/0	If it were up to me, the UK would remain in a reformed EU.
1/1	If it's a No Deal Brexit it can only be the remainers rioting cos all the leavers will be partying lol.
0/0	If it's not about money, why do brexiters still hide behind 'project fear' with the announcement of every valid economic warning ? The truth is that leave voters aren't prepared to pay the true cost of brexit and never have been.
1/1	If its this hard to leave now it will be impossible to leave in the future, once thats the case we will have lost our sovereignty. Time to leave now.
0/0	If just one of these deportees are not a criminal and are merely being got rid of because of dog whistle politics by this hard right, populist government, they will have more to answer to than opposition front benches. Is this another reason why Johnson wants the EHRC dropped from the statute books?
1/-1	If leaving the EU would be so devestating why are we giving a referendum?
0/0	If manufacturing companies knew they would have to pay heavy import duties they might think twice about Brexit.
0/0	If no deal means turning everything upside down as would happen with Brexit, then it's not better, it's tragic.
0/0	If one positive thing came out of Brexit is, as a European resident in the UK, that through twitter and in real life I got to know a lot of amazing British people who serve as a reminder that the UK is more than the troglodytes it kept sending to the to the European parliament. Love from a Franco-British
1/1/1	If one thing has come out of Brexit it is that the younger generation and their supporters like me really have a chance to make it work as a system.
1/-1	If only #UK had true, effective opposition and honest main stream media to bring this to #British people attention
1/1	If only eu doesn’t have that stupid free movement and refugee law
1/1	If only the "Remains" had enough, honest and open education - and true knowledge of the dictatorial EU and unelected bureaucrats, ,many "Remains" would have voted to leave!
0/-1	If only they had given Cameron something to bring back to the UK.
0/1/0	If only they have thought about consequences before voting for it but no.Good luck with Boris and his lying government to sort out everything.Sure he will do everything he has already promised cuz he never lies haha
0/0	If only we could forget brexit, then it could be the gift that keeps on giving money and human rights
1/-1	If only we got God Save The Queen to the top of the chart, then Brexit would have been a success. It's those remainers downloading the wrong song that done it.
0/0	If our goods don’t comply with EU standards they won’t buy them. It’s hardly rocket science!
0/0/0	If our standards will always be higher, why not align with the EU to save British businesses and farming ?
1/1	If over 350,000 is the net increase in the population can some one tell me how many British skilled people left Britain and how Many unskilled people arrive in Britain, because going on statistics the Government gives out it is closer to one Million unskilled people arriving in Britain every year. VOTE TO LEAVE
1/1	If people didn't bother to vote when they had the opportunity, tough
0/1	If politicians faced criminal prosecution for fraud, etc., instead of being protected by Parliament, would we be in this mess? Surely Brexit would have been binned by now.
1/1	If remain win, it's will be the saddest day in UK's history!!!!!!!
0/0	If some 12 to 24 months from now we find the country is doing very well, we have great new trade deals and are at least as well off, let alone doing better, I will very happily come on these pages and admit that I was wrong and you Brexiters were right.
1/0	If the "experts" were able to correctly anticipate the future with a reasonable probability, then they'd be entrepreneurs acting on their anticipations to participate in and contribute to the productive economy, not policy wonks. In other words, those who are poor at anticipating the future pontificate rather than participate.
1/1	If the EU can't come to a trade agreement before the end of 2020.. no problem. The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
1/1	If the EU don't want to deal respect their decision and look to others who do stop wasting time close the door and open another one just walk away.
1/1	If the EU drained the swamp, brought in more democratic decision making, and barred leaders of countries allowing in mass migration, then I would vote to remain or stop Brexit.
0	If the EU have signed it without crying about it then I'm afraid that cannot be good for the UK. No chance. Something fishy is going on.The third turd now signed.
1/0	If the EU heads towards a single state national identity will be lost as new laws reflect the views of europe and not individual coutries and the interests of the UK people are put second to the interests of the EU. A law institued in Germany might have totally different implications when instituted in the uk because they are culturally and economically different. A one size fits all policy doesn't work on region as diverse as europe. Intergration may be ok if it happened from the bottom up with the UK people pushing for greater unity but it isn't. It is happening from the top down and is being impossed on the UK people whether they like it or not.
0/0	If the EU is so bad then how come only a tiny minority of our parliment wants to vote leave?
1/1	If the EU is so successful why is it so afraid of competition? The EU has suffocated creativity and innovation in Europe and wants to ensure that we are trapped in their sphere of decline. Not one of the world's top 20 tech companies is European - even the Israelis are far ahead of European on tech development. Boris must ensure that we leave the EU graveyard and are free to rejoin the world of the living.
1/-1	If the EU really wants to be a union with its proper government, it should be better off without the UK (now the “divided kingdom”), unless they change their minds.
1/1	If the EU refuses to renegotiate or even discuss amendments to the backstop, then that proves that the Eurosceptics were correct and that the backstop was designed to keep the UK locked into the EU forever. They don't want us to leave because too many EU jobs depend on the UK. They also need our contributions to keep the Eastern Block happy spending our money. They can also use our money to build their Super state. Let Juncker, Macron, Merkel and Tusk explain to the rest of the EU why their intransigence has cost the £39 Billion. That is a hell of a price to 'punish' the UK!
1/-1	If the EU trys to lay guidelines we wont , alternate Nations will , and will benefit from filling the gap lol
1/1/1	If the EU wish to level THEIR playing field to match ours, that's up to them. But the days of telling us what to do are over.
0/0	If the Labor Party wasn’t led by a colorless incompetent and the Liberal party was’t lead by another boring incompetent, these two parties could have joined forces to build strong support to stay in the EU.   In their ineptitude, they actually colluded with Johnson and his fellow Brexiters. Unfortunately, the Democrats like the two “opposition” British parties may be put up a candidate who will allow the sociopath to continue his autocratic reign.
0/0	If the UK actually leaves the EU, then it’s going to take longer than a decade for any kind of trust to be re-established, if ever. So re-admittance at any level will take several decades to achieve.
1/1	If the UK does not leave the EU, it will demonstrate democracy in the UK and the EU is a farce, it's fake, an illusion, no better than North Korea !
1/-1	If the UK doesn't go through with Brexit, the whole voting process will be 100% delegitimized. Why vote when the vote is not upheld. The government will be exposed as a complete sham.
1/1	If the UK goes back to its old ties, a CANZUK trading block would be able to hold its own with the other global superpowers.
0/0	If the UK leaves the EU, Northern Ireland will leave the Union of the UK for Ireland and Scotland becomes independent. The UK will cease to exist, all that will remain is England+Wales.
0/0	If the UK leaves without a deal and in essence renege on its good friday agreement commitments, an international treaty, who on earth is going to trade deals with the UK?
0/0	If the UK votes to leave the EU then Scotland, Wales and NI should all leave the UK and let England go its own mad way.
1/1	If the UK wants to remove itself from the EU, then that's just one population group that isn't having its policy dictated by some large overlord government.
1/1	If the UK wasn't stripped of assets and industry being sold off we would of kept our independence. The country has turned into a free for all camp site for everyone around the world. It's not been respected nor treated and looked after like a home. The new breed of soft headed snowflakes have crippled the country. Mainly because less important things have been made a priority. Bring back tradition culture and disapline and make it a democracy again. We the people/tax payer tell you what to do. The government isn't to tell us what to do, we elect them we pay for them we own them. They should respect the English and their home. We don't go to other countries and do what they do yo us, they wouldn't tolerate it. It's all a mess and people in power DON'T have the best interests at heart. So this country WILL go down because corruption WON'T allow good to prevail. I'm English and my country is being turned into a world gateway and a business hub for other countries. My country is being stolen and given away. All those who died for our country and now it's for what????????? DISGUSTING AND SHAMEFULL our leaders should pay a penalty considering they don't hesitate to make the tax payer pay. It's treason it's betrayal it's deception. England should be England just like each other country should be it's own. After that we should continue to trade and work together. Simple without greed. News reporters and channels should give the truth but even you guys are bought, corrupt puppets being told what to do. So really there is no hope because your all full off utter shite and lies. People shall rise and wars shall happen. People will die and suffer all because the fat gits at the top don't care whilst hiding behind closed doors
1/0	If the UK were ever to leave the EU, it will be an impoverished *England* that, in a not so distant future, will be back, asking to be let in again. ON ITS KNEES.
0/0	If the brits want to ruin their economy thats fine for them
1/1	If the hard brexit happened northern Ireland might get freed and so might Scotland
1/1/1	If the majority of you is against Brexit, I'm sorry but you just didn't show up when it counted. 56 % of British electors voted for opposition to Johnson -- sure, but many of those vote for Labour, and many of the Labout voters are pro-Brexit.
1/1	If the remainers just hurry up and finish their tantrums, dry their eyes and get behind us putting Britain first, there’d be no reason why we can’t be a super power again
1	If the two main political parties fail to deliver the Brexit we voted they will destroy themselves, I have repeatedly emailed my local MP and TM to say that I will not vote for them again if they fail to deliver the will of the majority of eligible voters which was to leave, deals were not on the ballot paper just leave or remain.
1/1	If the uk leaves eu it will be pure bliss and brilliant for all uk citizens
0/0	If the vote goes the Brexiteer’s way I firmly expect to be arrested on the march tomorrow. Never been charged with any criminal offence but i’m at breaking point and very little to lose - i think i’d be quite proud to be able to frame the charge sheet and show my future grandkids that i actually stood up for something.
0/0	If there is a hard Brexit food prices will go up fore years to come.
1/1	If there is another referendum and we don’t fully leave the EU at the end of everything then I’m not going to vote ever again! This country is corrupt.
1	If there is any truth in that the Government are preparing to keep us in the Customs Union in order to save PMs deal. I will certainly vote against it. How can this be taking back contro
0/0	If there was a second referendum, and the result was still to leave, that would be the winner for mass stupidity of the century, second to venezuela.
1/1	If there was to be a second referendum, then it would be a betrayal of democracy. Just cause you didn't get the result you wanted, doesn't mean you can cry and want another till you get what you want.
1/1/1	If these REMOANERS would negotiate half as hard with EU like they do against LABOUR and BREXITEERS the UK would be in better shape.
1/1	If these foreigners worry so much about a 'No deal' and Britain's economy, then why are they so demanding and rigid in their negotiations with us. It doesn't add up does it?
1/1	If these people love the EU so much then go live in Europe..problem solved..bye
0/0	If they cared about what is right for the country they wouldnt be backing Brexit
1/-1	If they did that, they’d be flipping the bird at democracy.
0/-1	If they do not want to respect the rules and the standards of the single market, the more distant, of course, they will be
0/1/0	If they start building a wall in ireland things will get nasty
0/0/0/0	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
0/0	If they wanted to sort immigration out why have they done nothing about non-EU immigration the last 2 years?
0/0	If they were stupid enough to vote conservative, they’re stupid enough to leave the EU. I live in a country of ignorant suicidal morons.
0/0	If this is true, Brexit should be canceled and abolished right now.
0/0	If this was truly supported by the country why isn't there a feeling of triumph, millions on the streets, street parties galore the red arrows, I'll tell you why... It's because this is a shit sandwich
0/0	If this whole brexit BS has made me realise one thing, it's that I feel more European than British. This country and its 'leaders' are shameful.
1/1	If this woman doesn't understand why it is that people voted for Brexit....then prehaps she should look in the mirror. A complete "let them eat cake" attitude.
1/1	If we Vote Leave we will be able to stop handing over so much money to the EU and we would be able to spend our money on priorities here in the UK
1/1	If we are charitable, we could put this down to the EU's incomplete command of the English language. If not, it is yet another instance of their complete disregard and disrespect for us. The fact they don't seem to want to change it implies the latter ....
1/1/1	If we are denied Brexit again I very much fear we will start to see violence.
1/1	If we deny the people the opportunity to leave on 29th March, they’ll never forgive us.
1/1	If we didn’t have a transition period we would have crashed out which apart from a very small %of people no one wants. So yes we have to follow rules for 11 months, while we sort out a deal, I don’t see what the big deal is, and why those who clearly wanted remain are trying to turn this into a negative thing lol, they are getting a tissue to help dry those eyes until mommy and daddy’s divorce is final.
0/0	If we do end up leaving (I'm still hopeful a second referendum will come) I can't wait to see what / who / how middle England blames all their problems on going forward. It's been forginers and the EU for decades, soon these bigoted pricks will have nobody else to blame except the government who have screwed them for decades. Shame they couldn't see that before we voted.
1/1	If we don't get out now we will never get out ever again. When everyone realises that staying was the wrong decision, it'll be too late.
1/1	If we don't leave the EU, it will only be a matter of time before it's businessmen-politicians in Brussels, who are only in it for the money and power, will be the ones sending our troops off to war.
1/1	If we don't leave the EU, we should sack all the MP,s and the Lord's, they are no longer needed. The EU now makes all our laws so the MP,s are taking money on false pretenses. Aso we are now a rubbish dump for all the world's unemployables and gangster,s
1/1	If we don't need a trade agreement with them don't bother wasting time negotiating one . Personally I'm sick of the EU and their mind games.
1/1	If we don’t get out then it’s plan B: tear it up from the inside.
1/1	If we don’t leave on the 31st then the UK would have signed away its Democracy, Sovereignty and Beliefs.
0/0	If we exit, prepare to do worse.
1/1	If we fail to leave I fear the country will move to the right.
0/-1	If we go over the cliff, it will be the media's fault for giving the jingistic twats a platform. Shamefull.
1/1	If we had had the right people in charge, instead of the craven bunch we did have we could have had this position sorted, done and dusted by now!
1/1	If we had not joined we would still have a large fishing industry we would still have profitable coal industry and we would still have a steel industry, we would not have stupid rules like straight bananas and cucumbers
0/1/0	If we just stayed none of this bs would have happened
1/1	If we leave on WTO they will soon come running to do a good deal. Yes we will suffer some short term pain but it will be worth it
1/1/1	If we leave the EU we won't have to take the migrants that come in off the coast. Things will get more expensive which is good for the UK as we can earn a substantial amount of profit from things such as potatoes. Council taxes will be abolished and laws will become stricter, allowing the UK to have more power over itself. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE
0/0	If we leave the EU, I am moving to Mars.
1/1	If we leave the EU, and eventually we realise it was a bad idea we will be able to rejoin. If we stay in, we will stay in until we are eventually annexed into the United States of Europe.
0/0	If we leave the EU, the Italians will prohibit the sale of pizza in the UK #VoteRemain
1/0	If we leave with no deal brexit , fantastic manovering . Good job 🙂 Leave still tethered to eu hang your head in shame and go 😡
1/1	If we leave without a deal the EU will be responsible for the border in Ireland.
0/1	If we left the European Union with no deal there would be disruption to our trade, there would be disruption to European trade as well, it wouldn’t be in our best interests to do that. Of course it’s survivable but we don’t want to be putting our economy into a position of unnecessary turmoil. It wouldn’t be in our best interests to do that.
1/1	If we really do leave without a deal, the Brussels will lose the 39 billion quid at a stroke. The EU seems to think it can play hardball with us while we are expected to behave like gentlemen.
0/0	If we remain in the EU they'll unblock putlocker and add new shows on to Netflix #Voteremain
1/1	If we remain in the European Union,then the UK’s relationship with democracy is over!
1/1	If we stay in the EU and give more and more power to the EU over the UK then what? We would have the Germans, French and Dutch making decisions for us with their populations which together far outnumber the British.
1/1	If we stay in the EU and our economy grows, our contribution to the EU coffers will grow too. Therefore leaving the EU will allow the UK to grow and reinvest in our own country.
1/1	If we stay in... Forget about pensions ! Forget about the NHS ! With so many people on low wages there will be insufficient tax receipts. Our cherished system will be broken up and sold under the TTIP and practically everything will be privatised. The UK will become a broken two-tier state with the haves and the have-not, those that receive medical care through insurances and those that don't. We need to protect our economic and democratic rights as citizens. Vote OUT !
0/0	If we truly voted Brexit why are you so scared of a second referendum?
0/0	If we vote for Brexit it will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed, relocated or downsized.?
1	If we vote to leave then I think the union will be stronger.
1/1	If we vote to stay in the EU, we will be effectively voting away our very right to vote!
1/1	If we vote to stay, I will give up hope for this country
0/0	If we were not part of the EU, we'd get no say whatsoever in EU-wide issues...that's a terrible position to be in.
1/1	If we'd done that... we'd have an 80/20 outcome -- favouring CLEAN BREAK BREXIT.
0/0/0	If you #GetBrexitDone via #NoDeal then there is NO SUCH THING as “getting it done”, as you STILL have to do a trade deal (which takes 10yrs) & even then you’d have no more bargaining chips! The UK would be utterly on the back foot! Poker players cannot raise AFTER they’ve folded!
1/1	If you accept democracy, then you must accept Leave won, end of...
0/0	If you are celebrating this. Shame on you #BrexitCelebration
1/1	If you are going to make a hash of these talks just go for a No Deal, its what a lot of us want ! No more pandering to EU Bullies Tess, we told them what we wanted & they as always said NO, also not one penny leaves The UK !!

0/0	If you genuinely think leaving the EU by virtue of a 52-48 one-time non-legally binding public vote without any idea how things are going to be after you leave and still want all the good stuff that comes with being in the EU is a good idea, then I have some real estate on the far side of the moon I’d like to sell you.
0/1	If you guided it with gold renainers will not no matter what like it! So we go no matter what as soon as we can.
1/1	If you had to pay 80% of your income to a government that does nothing to fix crumbling hospitals, gives out early retirement pensions to 45 year olds, and tries to hire as many people to the public sector as possible to secure votes, wouldn't you try to avoid paying taxes also? This is the case in Greece my friends..
0/0	If you happen to be a brexiter, enjoy the moment, because it will not last.
0/0	If you have a trade mark, or a copy right, or even a patent, you don't have to take one out for each country. You can get one EU wide one for all 28 members.

1/1/1	If you look for excuses like nationalism then you will never understand why we voted for Brexit. It was a vote for DEMOCRACY.
0/0	If you love chaos, leaving the European union is the plan.
0/1	If you perpetually sack Remainers and retain Brexiters in the Shadow Cabinet @jeremycorbyn there are conclusions to be drawn: You want Brexit. You will sacrifice the members, Party Policy and Party Conference to get it. You welcome those with your views and sack those without.

1/0	If you think 2013/14 was bad, the next crisis will be blow-out horrible. All we can do to protect ourselves is to decouple our economy from the EU's so we're not dependent on them in any way.
0/0/0	If you think about it #Brexit is an excellent weight loss program. Everyone in Britain is guaranteed to lose several pounds.
0/0	If you think brexit will help workers you should resign your professorship Mark, you are right on a lot of things but not this for the UK.
1/0	If you think the British economy is going to flourish after a no deal, seek professional help
0/0	If you think you live in a democracy ,you're deluded.However,I hope it all works out without any problems, I just doubt it.Ireland's troubles are likely to restart and Scotland is likely to separate from the UK ,which will spell the end of the United Kingdom and if that happens what's left could easily slip in to obscurity.I hope none of this happens but votes have consequences and when only 2 of the 4 Kingdoms want to do something this fundamental to the country ,forcing the other 2 Kingdoms to go along, unrest is likely to ensue.When the UK joined the EU all the Kingdoms wanted it with a 62% vote for it ,now a little better than 50% vote in 2 of the Kingdoms and that is the end of the UK being in the EU,a recipe for disaster.
0/-1/-1	If you vote on hurt feelings instead of facts and critical thinking, you are a fucking moron.

0/0	If you would know European history, you would know the last decades have been the most peaceful decades in European history.
0/0	If you wrote a book about the history of hypocrisy Brexit would need it's own standalone volume.
0/0	If you're British and you haven't realized that Brexit is an attempt to isolate you from the protection of the EU so you can be put up on the auction block and sold, you're living in the same kind of delusion as trump supporters.
1/1	If you're for Brexit, give a thumbs up. Brexit won the argument AGAIN. We are leaving.
1/1	If you're going to vote out, please use a pen and not the pencils provided at the polling station. Papers were changed last time and they'll do anything they can to keep us in.
0/0	If you're having a "Brexit party" tonight, then you are deffo a nonce of the lowest order. Get fucked.
0/0	If you're leaving, just leave. But don't try to drag others along the way
1/-1	If your vote choice was based on the propaganda presented by both campaigns, then I can understand why you are upset but you are responsible for the way you are feeling because you have free will and you had the opportunities to do the research as I did and I voted leave. I for one spent many nights reading and educating myself on the history and foundation of the EU, reading official documents, opinion pieces, FACTS and I am comfortable and proud with my choice to vote leave. I believe that if more people performed unbiased open minded research then the Leave vote would of been higher purely based on the undemocratic and communist soviet style system the EU is based upon. Do the research. “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Mikhail Gorbachev (I like to think that he would know a Soviet Union when he saw one!) I actually believe that many people did not pay attention to the fear propaganda and voted based on what they see going on in their own communities. I know many that quickly got turned away from the fear inducing headlines that were chucked at us every day. It's telling to me that only the major cities and Scotland voted to remain. How many of those remain voters have visited the northern industrial or fishing and farming communities! A huge section of the Greater British society has been left behind, especially in areas where our industry was lost in the 80's. This was a huge factor in the outcome. I fully understand that these industries were replaced by services, tech and science and that the EU was providing a structural fund and I get that but the people in these affected communities obviously are not seeing the benefits or myself and these people would have one less reason to vote leave! I can see that immigration was a big contributing factor but I don't believe that immigration was the number one issue. I do believe that the establishment media is doing their best to make leave voters appear racist or xenophobic. I actually don't know one leave voter who could be considered racist or xenophobic and I know a lot. I consider the comments stating all leave voters to be racists inflammatory and dangerous. This type of commentary is what is causing division between reasonable open minded non racist & non xenophobic folk like myself who voted leave. Please try not to generalise as I would predict that a fair amount of the ignorant people wouldn't have even bothered to vote. I have spoken to a few people who could be considered ignorant and they didn’t care enough to register let alone to vote. I am not trying to say all leave voters are not racist because there is clearly an element but not all who voted leave are like that, far from it in fact. It's fair to say that both sides did not do well on addressing the immigration issue. I believe that if the remain campaign did a better job of presenting information and statistics to the concerned voter related to non EU migrants vs EU migrants entering the UK then it would of gone a long way to alleviating concerns but both campaigns were so bad that looking back it seems like they both wanted to get out. I think it's fair to point out that I have actually heard a fair few remain voters espouse some pretty ignorant racist comments in the past, unfortunately it is an unwanted part of our culture that sits in both camps I just see Leave voters unfairly targeted because of the direction of the out vote when many who voted Leave did not solely vote based on the immigration issue! So please be careful not to generalise and paint everyone with the same brush.. The last thing we need now is for this division between camps to extend on because that helps nothing. It’s time to think progressively as one, arguing and mudslinging isn’t doing anyone any favors right now. I voted for the communities I mentioned above and for what I can potentially see as a much brighter future for the whole country. I considered voting remain to be somewhat selfish and used my vote to speak for who I believe to be the disenfranchised that I believe have been victims of regressive and broken bloated EU now political system. I agree that our own political system is also largely to blame. My main reason for voting was to retain our democratic system and sovereignty so that generations to come have a chance at living in a free country not run by bureaucrats holding the reigns of power but unelected by the people of this great country. I voted leave fully aware of the economic consequences. I am prepared to take the hit for independence and to retain the democratic system that although flawed in places it works for the people and not corporations. It works so well in fact that it was exported around the world. Staying in the EU would have meant a gradual degradation of democracy as power gets centralised further into the hands of the unelected few. Some have said that going it alone is isolationist but I see remaining as being isolated within 27-member trade zone. Now we have the opportunity to trade on a global level. We do need to elect politicians who are capable of securing good trade deals but I am confident that if the EU doesn’t chose to punish in my view unfairly that good trade deals can be achieved because the Great British brand has always been strong and that will not change. As /u/tedcase pointed out: "We do not need to be chained to a Eurocentric attitude to trade and relations. We are not turning our back on the EU, we are opening the doors to the rest of the world and we are doing it on OUR terms, not the EU's. Do you think Japan suffers in trading with China because they have no say in the way China is run? Do you think the USA and Canada are unable to trade with each other because they have separate legislation? The whole planet trades with the EU (what's left of it) and they can get the best deals that are mutually beneficial for all. Member states cannot. The EU was a cartel, a protection racket at best." One thing I ask of all of you who have read this is the keep your eyes on the leaders of both parties because they cannot be trusted. We have Cameron (Bullingdon Club), Johnson (Bullingdon Club) and then we have Osbourne also (Bullingdon Club). Now if you are remain then you should probably consider this to be a good thing right! since they are all going to conspire together to find a way to not let us leave and they are already delaying the exit. How anyone can not see a conspiracy here I do not know! I don’t think that Boris can quite believe we had the balls to leave. I am of the opinion that he was put in the leave campaign to discredit it because he is a buffoon but obviously if that was the intention then it backfired because his propaganda as bad as it was it resonated. You can chuck insults at me if you like! It's water off a ducks back because I am comfortable in my decision and confident that providing we get the right people in power that our future is brighter out of the EU.

1/1	Immigrants arriving in Britain from the EU outnumbered Brits heading the other way by a 180,000 in 2016, placing unacceptable strains on housing, welfare and education.
1	Immigrants landing on our beaches in boats, European organised crime operating in the UK already due to open border, jails packed with foreign criminals and the government is all of a sudden concerned.
1/1	Immigration and Sovereignty...Leave Now!!
1/1/-1	Immigration quite honestly. Soverignty too.
1/1	Immigration. Needs to be stopped altogether. We are bursting at the seams to many have been let in. From January 2015 till now waiting list for doctors appointments. At my GPS surgery waiting time what once once 2 week wait is now 6 to 7 weeks. And when Turks get in it be even worser. We really do need OUT of the EU otherwise I can see that due to this overcrowding they will be lives at stake. But Cameron. Oblivious to all this he lives in a completely. Different world than us .. He destroying our country. PLEASE VOTE LEAVE .. Before its gets any worser
0	Import duty can be increased up to 10 % from 0% depending on the tariff codes

0/1	Impose fines, big ones by all means, but it stands under British law that the result of an illegally campaigned election can not stand... and yet here we are staring down the barrel of March 29th.. I believe the electoral commissions ruling on the legality of the 2016 result is due some time in late spring..
0/1	In 10 years time you wont find a single mp who will own up to voting in favour of Brexit. It wasn't me gov, honest.
1/1	In 10 years, the EU will be taking loans from the UK. Prosperity dead ahead.
1/1	In 15 or 20 years when this has become a massive success, the EU is floundering or has already ceased to exist I bet you won’t find a remoaner in sight. They’d be too embarrassed to admit they were one if the U.K. is booming again.

1/1	In 5 years there will be no EU
0/0	In Brexit wonderland, the clearer something is, the more unsayable it becomes. The need to delay article 50 is obvious True! But it would be much better to cancel the whole 'shitshow' completely, and stay in the EU, wouldn't it?
0/-1	In a long period term they can’t compete with the economic power of China, Russia, India, Brazil alone so they won’t never leave UE.
0/1	In a massive bit of schadenfreude, I argued heavily to my parents to vote remain. They told me that they were voting leave and why worry it wouldn’t effect me anyway. Apart from, it totally did as I immediately started having trouble with EU based suppliers and contractors who were worried about it. Anyway, because of Brexit, my dad is losing his job, the one he’s had since he was 17 years old. 39 years in the same role and it’s moving to Germany. I love him so I can’t even enjoy the irony of that
0/0	In a no-deal Brexit, Britain could also lose the continued access it has negotiated to European plane travel records and databases of vehicle registrations, fingerprints and DNA profiles. This is very bad.
0	In a year from now when the pound may be worth less than 1 euro, and all things that are imported, fruit, food, oil, clothes,electronics etc etc will be more expensive....The people that voted for brexit may regret what they have done to england...It's still time to reverse the brexit but the time is running out. Why not vote a second time to be really sure?
0/0	In a year the UK will extend their “transition period” for another year. boris is a fool.
0/0	In all of this campaign I haven't seen an argument for why I should vote to leave. Why would leaving be an improvement to the current situation? We will re-nogotiate a trading deal with Europe - Already have one so no improvement. We will save c£9bn we pay to EU - Total government spending is c£700bn, I can see the saving is a benefit but not a big one in the national scheme of things and I'm not sure that leaving won't end up costing us at least that in uncertain inward investment. Border controls - In my experience being able to have people move around EU (both in and out the UK) has been a great benefit. Many businesses I have worked for and with have seen this ability as a positive. Making that more difficult is a negative in my eyes (plus evidence that tax take > spending for immigrants) Sovereignty - We already have that and the bits we have pooled with the EU are beneficial. I haven't seen an argument which details how the UK will be better by taking back our sovereignty 100% I'm happy to read more about it and I'm open minded but the leave campaign have completely failed to sell me a positive reason to change.
1/-1	In any event, it is unclear what Cameron hopes to gain from a vote when he could get his way by simply throwing Britain's weight around;
0/0	In case anyone has forgotten the claims made by the leave campaign. The lies for which we have sacrificed our and our children’s rights as European Citizens.
1/1/1	In comparison to the United States we don't share a common past and we don't have a single flag to be proud of. There's too much rivalry and suspicion between countries.
1/1	In decades to come, 31st January will be celebrated as the day Britain was saved. It took a fight, but democracy has finally prevailed. Happy Independence Day!
0/0	In every Brexiteer comment I read, I'm sensing panic. I think most of them realize they did something very very damaging to the UK but, in true human nature, are now hell bent on pretending they didn't. That is why there is so much abuse being thrown at those who did not vote for Brexit.
1/1	In fact go watch Brexit the movie I can't be arsed explaining in full how the EU has turned its back on the UK but still expects us to lube up an take a shafting every time another failing EU economy needs a bailout to the tune of billions.
0/0	In fact, leaked documents suggest that Theresa May’s government planned to “scale down” climate and environmental protection
0/0	In fairness the media have a dilemma - all the facts so far show that Brexit is a massive mistake and will seriously damage this country and our lives (and our children's) for decades.
1/1	In like 50 or 80 years the UK would have become but a state in the EU.
0/0	In my complete sadness, the yobbish mentality that seems to have saturated the U.K. seemed to be everywhere, whist they celebrated and let off fireworks I feel I’m mourning the loss of a very close and much loved friend. My stability is shaken and I feel isolated from the country I must call home.
0/0/0	In my humble opinion Brexit is the single most stupid adventure besides the middle eastern wars any western country has thrown herself into in the course of the 21. century.
0/0/0	In my opinion I think we shouldn't leave the EU
0/0	In my opinion brexit is a lose-lose situation for everyone. ..
0/0	In my opinion brexit is a lose-lose situation for everyone. ...
1/1	In my opinion we all might take a hit at first. But Brexit is a process and the mistake is to assume things won't get better in the long run. In the long run, it's my belief that our economy will improve significantly.
1/1	In my opinion, British will exit the EU. British are very pompous and arrogant people
0/-1	In my opinion, it's amazing that the EU is allowing us such a reasonable deal. You'd think that they wouldn't want to be perceived as giving us a better deal so that other countries won't leave, so if we don't take advantage of this great opportunity, I'll be amazed! With that offer, there's easily enough time to conclude an agreement, but I get the feeling that it won't be as easy as that. It really is sad to let them go.
0/0	In my view, Brexit for a while was the stupidest decision in a free election or referendum since 30 January 1933.
1/1	In one sense it's awful, but in another, Britain needs to learn a little humility. We are a titchy country, not an imperialist power. It's time we behaved like it. Brexit will enable that.
0/0	In our opinion, Britain can find a lot of resources and economic aid in the EU and above all, it could also be an economic aid for us. So in conclusion, leaving the EU would be a big mistake for the UK and a great loss for the EU member states.
0/0	In principle, I am a remainer, and do not support the UK leaving the European Union.
1/1	In principle, a united Europe sounds great to me. But in execution, the current version stinks like a dead pig. Europe has weakened itself by allowing risky nations to apply for membership.
0/0	In short there are no benefits to Brexit except for the rich getting richer. So if you're rich, yay you!
1	In short, I approve. But I also appreciate the controversy. It’s a big deal for not just the UK, but for the entire EU. But this is how democracy works. The people have spoken, and they have their reasons—security and sovereignty in particular. I stand with those who voted for Brexit and with their reasoning; but for those that voted against it, I recognize the tremendous and frightening change that comes with it, and the implications for the economy. I am also disappointed in how the EU has tried to manipulate the UK political process and force a deal that is likely *not* what the people voted for. It’s time for the EU to genuinely acknowledge the UK’s sovereign choice as a nation, and start negotiating with them from that starting point, instead of trying to undo and undermine what’s done. It is also time for them to really try to understand why the voters chose Brexit, and deal with the underlying issues that led to it. Nobody is laughing. I have several Brit friends/colleagues, and I take this very seriously. You have been our allies for a very long time, and I hope that always remains the case.
0/0	In so many ways cursed Brexit is causing this country immense damage right now, and why? To uphold the self congratulatory delusions of grandeur of a small gang of low grade MPs. (You know who they are.)
1/1	In ten years time, when people see what is happening in a federalised Europe, they will be glad that we removed ourselves.
0/0	In terms of labor mobility, being out of the EU is not as good as being in and there might be a few other issues.
1/1	In the European Union, individual countries are not a problem, but the communist authorities :(
0/0	In the UK and the US .... Putin's Plan is Working Fine.Just Fine!
0/0	In the absence of an opposition worthy of the name it is absolutely crucial that papers like the Guardian hold this government to account. Brexit has given them carte blanche to do whatever they want and so far theyve been allowed to get away with it
1/1	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price.
1/1	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price. But they don't pay tax, mortgage, run families and cars and bills etc... they eat poorly and live badly so don't need the income to meet UK expected standards of living.
1/1	In the early 70's I bought a house just on my one normal wage. I worked a 35hr. week, not one minute more. I brought up my family, had annual holiday, ran a car, on one normal wage, with no debt ever, accept my mortgage. Us workers had strong unions, we had immense power, were treated well, employers had to they needed us, no unlimited cheap foreign labour then. It's been 47yrs of decline for the working man. It's been little by little so most, especially younger people, haven't noticed. I voted Leave FOR young people, so they can have the life I've enjoyed.
0/0	In the event we leave the EU and our economy and employment suffers we should sue those who ignored advice and drove us into a severe crisis

1/1	In the long run Brexit gonna be good, be part and have to pay for other peoples bills gonna take germany economi down woth to much wellfair for to little people actualy working
1/0/0	In the next few decades 5-10 new poorer countries will join, meaning that millions of poorer people will have the right to freely come to the UK, putting our population at over 80 million. This is unsustainable and will put too much pressure on our schools, NHS etc, and will obviously lead to higher crime rates. So in fact, immigration is a perfectly valid reason to leave.
0/0	In the words of Michael Bloomberg, Brexit is the “stupidest thing any country has done besides Trump”.
1/1	In the words of my lovely grandmother, as she voted Brexit on her postal vote, "It's not about my future, it's about yours"
1/0	In today’s uncertain world we need that shared strength more than ever
0/0	In two years Theresa May has attended to the needs of only one group - the far-right hard Brexiteers like Johnson and Rees-Mogg. She has ignored all the rest - the 16 million who voted Remain, the millions who did not vote, the upcoming next generations and even the moderates in her own party. Is the survival of the Tory Party so much more important than the survival of the country? If the worst prime minister of any country in history had ever had a proper job, like, for example, that of a primary school teacher, then she would know that the easiest way to draw attention to yourself is to be a nuisance. Farage and UKIP were a nuisance - but small and ignorable until their tactics were copied by Rees-Mogg’s foul group, who learnt how to be nuisances themselves. Theresa May has shown herself to be just too weak, too stupid and too incompetent to slap down these unpatriotic, destructive nuisances. They have had her total attention, instead of being made to stand in the Naughty Corner.
1/1	In war time we got supplies into the country as U Boats were sinking our shipping. We voted LEAVE and whatever that brings. LEAVE NOW.

0/0/0	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic, and would gladly see European countries develop an alternative and leave the EU behind.
0/0	Indeed take a bow brexiters, you must be so proud. You will now have PM Boris Johnson to get a better deal than a truly respected statesman Cameron, good luck with that one... You must feel liberated now you will have 'control'... 1) The multi national companies making the DECISION to move their EU base from London and invest elsewhere - JP Morgan, Airbus and believe me many, many more to follow. 2) The EU having to TELL US what the leave terms are 3) Taking back our borders even though ANY trade deal must have freedom of movement. 4) Pensions that will face a decade of uncertainty as markets toil and the economy shrinks - just look at today's NEGATIVE CREDIT rating. 5) The prospect of the Scotland DECIDING to break up Great Britain. Thank goodness my children have a decade before they need to find work and I have many years before retirement. Great Britain, whatever that may look like in 5 years, faces a dark future. Will the last person to leave please turn out the lights.
0/0	Indeed the main trait of Bojo’s personality is laziness so he had two options here:(1) work a lot for a deal that will not satisfy everybody in the Brexiter side...alienating some people from supporting him and his party. (2) or do nothing then blame the EU ( easy ) and satisfy and expand his political base...
0/0	Indeed! Only a fool believes everything they read in the newspaper. Especially if that newspaper is the Mail, Telegraph, Sun or Express - all Tory rags pedalling fake news to the masses!

1/1	Instead of being so condescending and childish, work on building our future positively. Stop giving Brexit a bad name.

1/0	Interesting Opinion. I still feel open migration is a threat to all decent society and a significant cause of all our troubles. Even visa overstays threaten any nation. We are not one world or one people. England must be free of encumbrances. England must stay English, same principles for the Dutch and French.
1/0	Interesting behavior - don't like results , find collusion
0/0	Interesting comments about being pushed around by the EU. Wait until we have a trade agreement with the US, then we'll see the true meaning of being pushed around!

1/1	Interesting how not 1 of them mentioned any single specific thing the EU has done for the citizens of the EU states.
0/0	Interestingly, Brexitons rarely claim that they "won" fair and square. They merely bleat, incorrectly, that the Remain campaign also lied and overspent - in other words, "We cheated better than you." And they call that democracy.
0/0	International banks and companies are already relocating their businesses to the EU, although it is not yet clear that there is a hard Brexit. Once the no deal brexit is determined, most international companies will leave your misty island and leave hundreds of thousands unemployed. Brexiteers and thousands of trolls he pays to spread nonsense are Putin's useful idiots in destabilising Western democracies - first UK.
0/0/0	Into the valley of economic suicide rode the Light in the Head Brexit Brigade!
0/0	Invades half of the world and now has problems with immigrants.....
1/0	Ireland says we got to this deal after two years of negotiations..no we didn't. The EU didn't negotiate for months until they got our assurance of gettimg our money. Merkel refused to discuss EU citizens rights until then. So the EU are not innocent on this, they wasted time.
0/0	Ireland will receive copious EU backhanders and so will not be crucified. Germany will now sell more cars to Japan, Canada & British Bankers relocated to Frankfurt. In fact replacing UK models with EU/Canada/Japan compliant models will increase profits per vehicle As has been said before, EU will catch the common cold, UK will catch double pneumonia
0/0	Ironic that we leave at 11pm tonight because that's midnight in Europe. We're one hour behind. From tomorrow we'll be 50 years behind.
0/0	Ironically London has to deal with the most immigration for the longest time and they voted to stay. So yes rest of England you are blaming all your problems on immigrants. They aren't taking your jobs. Jobs are being affected by a recession that England has only just come out of. Your solution was to exit the single market and put us back into it. I'm glad I moved to Asia and hope never to return.
1/0/0	Irony of basically throwing support behind a Brexit style party
0/0	Is Airbus a threat? Is JLR a threat? Is Barclays a threat? Is Dyson a threat? Is EMA loss a threat? Is the @The_IoD known for lying? The relentless ignorance of you & Leavers is astonishing.
0/0	Is Brexit done yet? Thought not.
0/-1	Is Britain leaving ? Where ? To another world ? Lmao.
0/0	Is anyone sorting out another anti-brexit march? We need to get out into the streets of London again!
1/0	Is going to take away your sovereignty, democracy, own constitution, laws, army, basically every notion of who you are.
0/0	Is it because they think they’re better than the rest of Europe? We’ll see about that. Oh and they are NOT, by the way.
0/0	Is it just me or are all the leave voters OAPs or people teens who do not know the repercussions of leaving?
0/1	Is it not a bit wasteful in a way. I mean the UK leaves so there’s less regions to represent but they keep the posts anyway and continue to spend money the UK is no longer contributing.
1/0	Is it only me that realizes we are actually still adhering to the rules we agreed to when we were members of the EU but now we have no say in those rules yet we still adhere to them until we leave the EU.
1/-1	Is it something like a hate crime or just a sense that white people have been left behind?
0/0	Is it this simple? May can’t blame the disaster on the people who caused the disaster because it would finish the party. So she’s conspiring with the people who caused the disaster to blame the disaster on the EU, secure in the support of media which helped cause the disaster.
0/0	Is it time for a "told you so" comment yet or are brexiteers still too occupied with the happy thoughts of no foreigners and blue passports.....
1/0	Is the European Union bad for Europe? Sure, just take a look at European history before the creation of the EU: Things were so better back then
1	Is the UK still Safer in after the #BrusselsAttacks http://bit.ly/IsUKSaferIn #Brussels #Brexit
1/0	Is the border between Gibraltar and Spain a potential problem. Gib will soon be free of the EU. How about Cyprus? EU Greek Cyprus and the Turkish occupied north. Border crossing is not a problem. How about the Isle of Man and Channel Islands? Both part of the British Isles, but not members of the EU. The EU is just looking for problems. The Irish border is a matter for the UK & Ireland, not Brussels/Berlin.
0/0	Is the vote of 2016 of ill informed people valid? NOW people are informed of what Brexit, its consequences and options mean.
0/0	Is there anyone else who hates the fact we are leaving the EU today
0/0	Is there not a TINY part of you, oh great architects of #Brexit, that thinks you just might have got this horribly wrong, that you might prove to be responsible for unprecedented misery and the sad demise of a country that, until you got your hands on it, was a force in Europe?
0/0	Is there still HOPE for UK to stay in the EU
0/0/1	Is this a joke??? We now have border checks with numerous countries because of your #Brexit!
0/-1	Is this brexit process messing about just currencies manipulation simply by new words which change the course of the GBP SIGNIFICANTLY moments after ?

1/-1	Is this supposed to be a 'gotcha' moment. They voted on brexit and they want to get out of this steaming pile of shit called the EU. No one is begging to be let back in, this is just bullshit propaganda.
1/1	Islam has a lot of hate and intolerance in it. No reason for the UK to instead pretend to love and tolerate it. Step 1 is Brexit. I hope they get their country back.
1	Islamisation is the End of Europe and all of Europeans, through their indifference, are complicit. Because they abandoned their values ever since the ’cultural revolution’ of the ’70s and raised their children with comfort as the only value, they’re now reaping the consequences. We’ve made the wisest choice, thanks God Britain is out !
0/0	Isn't funny how UK says EU bullys them and restricts them but when they turn around and do it to the Scots it's not seen as bullying and restricting Scots but their right on Scots? Aren't humans so predictably biased towards themselves without giving a thought to holding themselves accountable! It boils to one fact and all say it simply you cant keep shouting about rights of u dnt talk about your responsibilities! 20 century marked by nonsensical one sided conversation about all talking about their right but no one talking about responsibilities lying with each side of the argument! Thts the only bloody problem. Aim to strike a concious balance between rights and responsibilities and you will realize the world appears absolutely different. Being committed to reslove issues than being committed to be on the right on every effing thing!
1/1	Isn't it amazing that you have accomplished in such a short time what Theresa May couldn't in years. You could tell she never supported #Brexit and didn't care what Brits wanted and voted for. Same in US with Democrats. Only President Trump has kept his promises. Why we love him
1/1/1/1	Isn't it great to be the out of the EU ? Like having escaped alive from a burning building, we can now watch as it self-destructs from a safe distance.

0/0	It all ends in no deal and bad relations with the eu and Ireland.
1/1	It allows the UK economy to remake itself into a much more USA style
1/0	It amuses me that you seriously think we're afraid of leaving. Very funny. Good one.
0/0	It appears that #BorisJohnson is getting cold feet over a no deal #Brexit. We told him and his #Brexiteer friends that it wouldn't work which is why he's having to back away. He'll have to give in over fisheries, free movement and on divergence. It's all falling apart.
0/0	It baffles me how people can support what happened. Look at how much the value of the british pound dropped already. Look at all this trade that suffers. Is that really worth making the lives of immigrants harder? I dont think so. Britain's people chose xenophobia over their own interests.
0/0	It baffles me why people who don't like the Guardian's political views take umbrage at them for having them. We get it, the Guardian is an elitist paper that doesn't listen to the British people. Thanks for that. Now toddle back to the Daily Mail and Sun websites where you can celebrate the rise of a new Britain with your peers.
0/-1	It begins infidels. Brexit was a hell of a battle. This is the actual war.
1/1	It better be at 23:00 on the 29th of March 2019 as promised by Theresa May. I want to wake up on the morning of the 30th March 2019 living in a free democratic country once again. NO more being controlled by those unelected eu bureaucrats we had for 47 years. That day will be OUR independence day!!
1/1/1	It blows my mind how the Brexit debate is always framed as one of 'racism vs anti-racism' - the idea that if you believe Britain should leave the EU you're somehow racist and hate European cultures. Do these Remainers not understand that the EU is destroying the cultures it has assimilated? Do they not see that the EU represents an absolute dilution of dozens of cultures into one giant, bland, monolithic single culture with no nuances? If you care about cultures then you should be opposed to the EU. How on earth the EU managed to convince people it was on the side of cultures is beyond me. No wonder most Remainers tend to be the kind of people who believe in Identity Politics - they have to be obsessed with identity because they've pissed most of it away.
0/-1	It can be undone, but people need the stomach for it - determination is required.
1/1	It certainly was not when we were in the corrupt eu.
0/0/0	It comforts me to know that however bad a day I have tomorrow, at least I’m not Boris Johnson.
1/-1	It constantly smears Eastern Europe
0/1	It could begin the unraveling of the EU all together.
0/-1	It curbs the ability of large multinationals to profiteer via divide-and-conquer. If they are selling good at price A in Spain and price B (half of A) in France, Spanish customers can go to France and buy the goods without any comeback.
1/1	It didn't have to be this way; but the EU has now turned into a cult, supported by brainwashed acolytes who refuse to see what is happening. Their compound is rapidly being surrounded, yet their unelected leaders continue to convince them that all is well. The 29 March cannot come soon enough!
1/1	It does make me laugh how they think they are so FREE within the EU. If a country wants to have a trade agreement with us they are told they aren't allowed to. How is that Freedom? Some un-elected Tosspot telling my country who I can and can't trade with. THANK GOD WE'RE OUT.
0/0	It does not feel thought trough
0/1	It does seem that the best policy would be to remain in the EU and address the issues that made people vote leave, but what were those issues? I have been trying to analyse why so many people did vote leave and still support leave despite all the new information about the consequences of Brexit. It is not about money as it is generally accepted that nearly everybody in the UK will be financially worse off as a result of Brexit and would be much worse off with the no-deal scenario that many people support. The less well off will be the hardest hit financially. It is not about trade deals. If we leave the Customs Union we will lose 80 trade deals that we already have and benefit from as a member of the EU. It is not about immigration from the EU. Last year net immigration from the EU was 74,000 and falling while immigration from outside the EU was 248,000 and rising. It is not about preserving our culture. Immigrants from the EU have shared similar histories to us, they are also predominantly Christian or have no religion. Immigrants from outside the EU, who will largely replace EU migrants, will be mainly from Asia and Africa and will be predominantly Muslim, Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist and have markedly different histories, i.e rather more culturally diverse than immigrants from Europe. It is not about security or influence as we will be losing our seat on one of the most important forums in the world, probably second in its influence only to the UN. It is not about jobs as 28% of British companies have said that they have already made plans to move part or all of their businesses out of the UK in the event of a no deal. So that seems to leave sovereignty as the reason why people want to leave the EU. They prefer to be governed wholly from Westminster, however good or bad the government is, rather than being governed partly by Westminster and partly by the EU. Personally, as a citizen of the UK and the EU I don't care which governs me. I only care about whether they do it well or badly. I have generally been very dissatisfied with the Westminster government over the last 40 years. Although I don't agree with everything the EU does or has done, in general I feel it has been doing a reasonably good job over the last 40 years. Nearly all the problems in the UK that I recognise, are directly attributable to Westminster policies and have little or nothing to do with the EU. However other people may have different experiences and problems that are attributable to the EU. I haven't seen them articulated as yet, so I am still confused about why so many people voted to leave the EU and still support leaving the EU.
0	It does seem that the people of Britain have changed their minds and no longer want Brexit. Not to mention its implications for ordinary people - the NHS will go, for a start.
0/0	It doesn't matter what is tabled, corbyn will be against it. There will be little progress and growing costs while that snake runs the Labour Party.
0/0	It doesn't seem like ppl know why the UK joined the EU in the 70s.. It was simply because it's economy was failing, not to long after they joined it's economy started to pick up and now ppl want to leave how does that make sense??
1/1	It doesn’t matter anymore BREXIT is happening whether you like it or not. Rule Britannia
1/1/1	It doesn’t really matter, what matters is we are now governed by politicians who are actually accountable to the electorate, it’s called democracy. Unfortunately the EU is no longer a true democracy.
0/0	It feels odd listening to educated people in background talking about leaving. and also disheartening. And blaming EU seems so odd
1/1	It has been difficult for the EU to effectively resolve the immigration crisis, and immigrants will take up jobs and schools for British citizens. I support Brexit and we can control immigration.
0/0	It has begun. Let it all crumble down. Burn to the ground in ashes and then rebuild. I warn ye.
1/1	It has features very few people like (e.g. the unelected Commission and the parliament with little power, the fact that it is a mighty block with no foreign policy of its own).
0/0	It has it's problems and has had for many years, but that is no reason to abandon the EU. The EU is as much about the future as the present, it is about what is best for this Country and our children and the EU holds the best prospects for both.
0/0	It honestly never ceases to amaze me how this shit and Trump all happened in the same year.
1/0	It is a POLITICAL Union, but the British never got it. That is one of the reasons why Brexit happaned

0/0	It is a catastrophe: economically, politically, socially.
0/1	It is a fact that they have professionally squandered Winston Churchill’s legacy
0/0	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract.
0/0	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract. Sadly, the simplistic pro-Brexit arguments appealed to a lot of people who were looking for simplicity. Either yearning for long gone days of British supremacy, or looking for someone to blame for their own lives. 'It's the EU's fault that you're poor. It's immigrants' fault that you struggle to find a decent job. It's not the global financial system, exacerbated by the deliberate policy choices of the British government at all!'
0	It is a genuinely dangerous situation. What happens when people actually do realize the cost of brexit, and rather than protecting institutions like the NHS, will likely destroy them. What happens when Labour's promises of rolling back austerity turn into ash as the UK government faces a serious post-brexit fiscal crisis?
1/1	It is a great pity that the Remainers are incapable of seeing the aims of Brussels. It will be like the Jackboots over again just without them. Oh how I wish they would wake up.
0/-1/0	It is a joke, England in Thatcher era urged the world to globalized now hahahahah

0/0	It is a sad day for the UK
0/0	It is a sad moment and I believe it is a loss both for Europe and for the UK.
0/0	It is a sad moment for Europe. I can' t understand why somebody can hate so much his european civilization, european heritage, european culture, european ancestors, to do this. Perhaps we can talk about poverty, analphabetism, lack of school, lack of facilities, lack of future facilities, unmotivational life. Very strange for a country so called european.
0/0	It is a shitshow, and there should never have been a referendum on this. The only reason David Cameron called one is because of stupid party politics, not for the good of the country or for democracy or anything like that. Most people don't know even nearly enough about the EU, how it works, how it benefits us, its long term strategies etc. People genuinely think that the EU 'controls' the UK and that unelected officials in Brussels make up laws and force us to adopt them, which is just utterly untrue. There is so much misinformation that it's scary - democracy is obviously a great thing, but only when the electorate actually have the facts, when the media is unbiased etc. As it stands, people are voting totally blind and ignorant. The EU does more for our country than our own government, particularly for the poorer areas. If the UK votes out, it means our government will lurch to the right. Even if you're not pro-EU, if you're not keen on the idea of a very right-wing era being ushered in, then vote remain.
0/0	It is a sign of how far Britain has sunk that anyone would think the lazy, posturing nincompoop Johnson is a serious prime minister, let alone a potentially great one.
0/0	It is a weakest decision Britain had done so far.
1/1	It is a wonderful day and a new beginning. Looking forward to new civilized partnerships and future growth as an independent trading nation. Love you too x x
1	It is about time you remainers see the true EuropeanUnion .IT is their way or no way.We need to stand as one against the none elected Bullies of Brussels.
1/1	It is an absurd another referendum on the same shit. People already decided, you cucks!
0/0	It is because ignorant voters like yourself have no idea how modern economies work, that we are in this mess.
1/1/1	It is better to be alone than in an abusive relationship.
0/0	It is clear that the world markets from Asia to the USA all genuinely think that not only will the UK be better off in a REMAIN, so will the global economy. They have no axe to grind in UK politics. They are looking at it dispassionately. Much as Europe irritates me sometimes, I am not voting to trash the UK and the global economy on the flimsy xenophobic ill-informed non-sense coming out of the leave camp. They cant even get the basic facts right and feel the need to exaggerate wildly about Turkey and UK contributions. If they want to leave, they can. They can go to Southampton and take a Ferry wherever they want, and they can take Nigel Barage with them.
1/0	It is disgraceful. Hitler would be proud of these kind of tactics.
0/0	It is easy to blame, it is harder to take responsibility for the future economic growth of a country without any real certainty. We have told our biggest and best trade partners to no longer trust us. We have told our own citizens that they will have to pay tariffs most likely or even duty on imports that they rely upon. "Buy local!" will be the cry, and that may have some good effects but with limited exports and looming disasters on car manufacturing, the economic model is not looking at all well. So blame everyone else and avoid media scrutiny. That should at least ensure the erosion in popularity is a little slower. But in the end, it creates an opportunity for the Opposition to organise properly this time. We will need a healthy dose of reconstruction after this fiasco has played out.
1/-1	It is easy to make threats when you're hiding behind somebody else. Barnier thinks the EU has far more global power than it actually does
0/1	It is eight weeks till we leave the EU. And we don’t know anything about what kind of Brexit it will be. I cannot really believe I wrote this and I am not dreaming.
1/1	It is far more likely that our growth will exceed the 1.5% they attribute to signing up to Mendacious May's Appeasement of the EU.
1/1	It is getting tiresome, listening to people telling me what I did and didnt vote for, when I voted leave. Some of us have these things called principles. I voted to LEAVE, if that means we are poorer in the short term then so be it.
1/1	It is good to see an academic who tries to balance the Armageddon prophecies of the Remain propagandists. We now need a paper laying out the psychological effect of freeing ourselves from the bureaucratic, moribund EU.
1/1	It is highly desirable therefore to free ourselves up to trade with the rest of the world which is growing more rapidly.
0/0	It is impossible for me, a well travelled, cosmopolitan, European to understand how so many people have been taken in by so many transparent lies. To comprehend how other intelligent individuals cannot see through the deceipt and the corruption.
0/0	It is just a new way to blame the UK problem on the EU. Now the EU is so cruel and arrogant cause of not renegotiate backstop what is already agreed on. They simply can’t do that. If u crash, they will tell u the EU is playing unfair so u can’t get trade deals, it’s all just for political gain.
0/0	It is manifestly "wrong" because it makes no sense, it doesn't solve their problems, it doesn't give them any more "sovereignty", it gives more power and influence to the very people who make their lives hell and the whole nation will pay for it for decades of lost wealth, health and reputation.
0/0	It is more likely Scotland will leave the UK and thereby end the Great brittan union than the loss of the UK will lead to the end of EU

0/0	It is not something to celebrate
1/1	It is not surprising that the unelected bureaucrats of the EU have not thought this through and what will happen when their fascist bullying leads to trade under WTO terms. Before our homegrown Remtards throw a track may I suggest they research what the tariffs are when goods are imported into the EU under WTO and where does the money go. Now apply those rules to EU27 goods imported to the UK and see where the money goes. KERCHING!!
0/0	It is not the EU that is destined to collapse, but the UK, as Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede from the UK to apply independently to the EU. No more UK. No more Great Britain. No more Britain, Just little England drifting away, free at last, just like some of the homeless zombies most of us have encountered in our downtowns who see themselves as so much freer than the rest of us, slaves to jobs, cars, families, bills and mortgages. Meanwhile, the EU goes from 28 to 27, then to 31. There were precedents for the whole affair. On page 74 of "The Government and Politics of the European Union", 7th Edition, 2010, a part of The European Union Series, discussing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty of 2004, author Neill Nugent states that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, "anticipating the next general election, responded to a Conservative Party promise that it would call a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty by promising one himself." Cameron was just a copy-cat. Who failed EU History 101. In the next paragraph, Nugent wrote, over six years ago: "A referendum is, of course, much more difficult for a government to control than a parliamentary vote. Citizens can 'cause problems' in two ways: by taking a contrary view to the government on the issue at stake, or by expressing a view on an issue or issues other than the one that features in the referendum question.. Both of these 'problems' influenced voting when ratification referendums were held in France on 29 May 2005 and three days later in the Netherlands on 1 June.... The outcomes of the two referendums were clear rejections of the CT.... The question then became 'what now?'" Doomed to repeat it! Cameron will have special prominence in the 8th Edition. And a few other places. The wave that ruled Britannia.
0/0	It is obvious now that brexit will become a series of exceptions that only benefit the rich, or big industry and the banks. Travel will be compromised for 'normal' tourists, the pound has already collapsed, and the NHS cannot run without staff.
0/0	It is only right, and the UK should not expect to get something for nothing. The UK played themselves, and I hope they get fucked.
1/1	It is over for the EU.
0/0	It is patently obvious that we were not informed enough to make a vote. They made a vote showing discontent and I understand this discontent. However I believe we are all more informed now to make a better call on this.
1/1	It is pointless voting for pro EU freeloaders like most of our MPs are then whining when they try and sabotage Brexit.
1/1/1	It is possible to have a trade deal done this year....I am totally convinced that the relations with the UK are stable, and after Brexit will be even better...and of course we have globally, common interests.
0/1	It is possible to leave the EU!I want to send this message to French people.
0/0	It is probably the biggest fuckup to happen in Europe since WW2 and it would be ridiculous to not say so
1/1	It is reasonable to believe that older voters voted to leave , I as one voted to leave the EEC in the 1975 referendum , older voters have experienced EU membership over a long period and a better placed to judge the merits of the EU . Britain wanted to join the EEC , I think John Major made a big mistake to sign the Maastricht Treaty without a referendum . I do not believe that young people are EU enthusiasts , it is EU officials politicians and business people who push the idea .
0/0	It is sad. A German friend of mine went & posted some pics on facebook. She is a media professional and has lived in the UK for at least 25 years. She was very upset about brexit and considers Britain her home.
0/0/0/0	It is seriously going to hurt UK and in the end EU will offer to help and let them back in but only if UK agrees to specific terms unconditionally.
1/1	It is simple, the fact is that the leave campaign wins. What is the problem?
1/-1	It is simply vital that we continue to highlight the positive case for Brexit as we go through the negotiation process
1/-1	It is so good the UK doesn't need EU workers good that brexit is going to stop them coming over and taking our jobs, no shortage of farm workers, hospital staff or workers needed in industry. It is time the brexit supporters wake up and stop running down our country, stop brexit or have an informed reforendum before it is too late
1/1	It is stupid to sold out your country to a bunch of Un-Elected politician(EU).
1/0	It is stupid to stay in EU.
0/0	It is surprising how many of the Brexiteers have no clue which way up the union flag should be flown so I don't think they have much credibility in who ,why and how flags should be used.
0/-1	It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries Theresa May has sat immobile inside of the British Parliament. She is the master of Brexit by the will of the Queen, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by the might of her inexhaustible promises. She is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with the power of strong and stable government. She is the Carrion Lady of Great Britain for whom a million votes of no confidence are rejected every year, so that she may never truly die.
1/1	It is the Brexiters who were, and still are, fighting for independence and freedom. Thank goodness the Remainers and their intolerant hatred of democracy was defeated.
1/1	It is the beginning of the end for the EU
1/1	It is the first step to genuine sovereignty. This is bad? I think it's good for any country.
1/1/1	It is the function of extremely complex and formal rules-based systems to crush the life and spirit out of the lay people under their jurisdiction. The EU are truly the Vogons of Europe and we will be far happier now we are almost free of them.
1/1	It is the piecewise different sound bites on proBrexit Nigel, etc. they’ve heard strung together into a train of incoherency. I did a better job in a complete presentation fail not having read the book for a class at 12 years of age cheating and using the abbreviated Cliff Notes
1/1	It is the remain supporters who will find the future hardest to reconcile with. To have so little pride and faith in your country is a heavy cross to bear.
0/-1/-1	It is the same people who claim there is a climate crisis. They have no grasp on reality, and/or no interest in the truth
0/0	It is the worst thing to happen to UK since WW2
0/0	It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism...We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.
1/1	It is time to bomb the EU.
1/1/1	It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren’t in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
1/1	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU, who for sure have their own Empire building agenda to why they do want they do. This is why the people want to leave, we want our leaders back, not puppets.

0/0	It is very sad. We live in a troubled world. Many people seem to vote without engaging their brains. I just want peace, people to get along with one another, respect their differing opinions and engage in building communities with trust and kindness.
1/1	It is well known that for democracy to work those that lose a vote have to accept the result...otherwise you have a Banana Republic. We voted leave. That is: leave the SM, leave the CU and leave the ECJ.
0/0	It is wrecking lives; has led to a surfacing of racism, xenophobia and violence; and will cause misery.
1/1	It isn't goodbye, it is hello from an independent UK.
1/1	It isn't goodbye, it is hello, from an independent UK.
0/-1	It looks now like Brexit will get cancelled as the government Knows they would lose a 2nd referendum anyway! The public was severely mislead into voting to leave EU!
0/0	It makes Britain poorer, weaker, less influential, less respected, bitterly divided.
0/0	It makes me feel like the US and Britain are in some weird competition to out-moron each other
0/0	It makes me so mad. We're being stripped of our E.U. citizenship against our wills.
0/0	It makes me so sick, in fact I have just emailed genealogist this evening to check whether my grandmother was actually born in Ireland. I am that desperate to remain in the EU.
0	It makes no different for Britain; the distance between Britain and the rest of Europe is actually the same as yesterday.
1/1/1/1/1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
1/1	It may be geographically part of Europe but that’s where it ends I for one am English not European I would like to decide that for myself and not be told what I gave to be.. Thanks.
1/0	It means great britain will disolve...ireland and scotland will soon go their own way.Nobody in the world cares about england.Europe will come out stronger than before.
1/1/1/1	It means it is the beginning of the ending of Globalism! It is the start of a glorious age! Next stop is TRUMP 2016.
0/0/1	It means the UK's economy is screwed for the next 3-5 years. Have fun with that.
0/0	It means: 1. Recession 2. Loss of economic influence in a global economy 3. Loss of cultural influence 4. The break up of the U.K. Great job Dominic!
1/-1	It might not all be true, but a hell of a lot of it is... I will be happy to see the EU crumble and Europe flourish once again... to regain it's cultural mantle...
0/-1	It must be painful for the BBC to admit.
0/0	It needs to be understood by everyone that large corporations such as Airbus are not making irrational threats when they talk about relocating operations after Brexit
0	It never was. It was the will of Boris so he and his American friends could get richer. Only 40% of Brits, if that, voted for Brexit.
0/-1	It only makes sense that any company wanting to sell into the EU would be required to meet EU rules...and that if that company is outside of the EU they'll need to show that they're meeting those rules for their product. This was always going to be expensive as they'll also need to meet UK rules for their product. So twice the overhead (at least as long as they rules aren't mutually contradictory in which case they may need to produce two different versions of the product).
1/1	It says a lot about the government and parliment.. When they keep remain on a table when all of them were Elected on a manifesto to leave...
1/1	It says something about the dire moribund intellectual void that is pro Euro leftist dogma, that when a nation democratically leans toward cessation from a failing inept corrupt undemocratic illusion of prosperity, such as the EU.
0/0	It seems an absolute shit show and I can't help but wonder if, after all this trouble and doubt, some people might like to vote again. That said, we've got enough of our own issues I'm not going to throw any stones in the foreign relations area unless someone asks.
1/1	It seems clear to me that politicians and technocrats are moving towards bigger unity within the continent but the project is quite flawed for the very specific reason that we live in a continent with over 30 countries, each with their own culture, history and... economies.
0/0	It seems like Brexit is a miserable failure of our time.
1/1/-1	It seems like the UK was always one foot out of the EU, but separating completely still perplexes many.
0/0	It seems so irresponsible that the BREXITEERS went to the British public with all kinds of promises, but they didn't have a PLAN for how to exit the EU. It has turned out to be a nightmare. where is Farage now? Where is Boris?
0/0	It seems that Brexiteers are living in their own, PARALLEL UNIVERSE! The EU is 12X BIGGER than the UK! Who do you THINK will dictate terms of TRADE??
0/-1	It seems that Ireland, in the north and Scotland had other notions !
0/0	It seems that the patients have all broken out the asylum today.
0/0	It seems that they're having fine time in Parliament these days. Apparently they haven't fathomed the fact that they are down the drain if they don't remain a member of the most significant European organization in all of history. It seems they have never realized the importance of having a European Germany rather than a German Europe. Rescind the Brexit-nonsense, call off the "divorce". We all want you among us, the united peaceful European Nations. Why indeed antagonize yourselves from the obvious common good? In many ways you are special, but NOT that special! Greetings from Denmark.
1/1/0	It seems the BrexiTraitors not only expect the UK to break the Good Friday Agreement but want a return to the Troubles.
0/-1	It seems the fools in the North and the Midlands who voted for this charlatan are gonna get their comeuppance!
0/0/0/0/0	It seems to me that the UK is shooting itself in the foot.
0/0	It seems to me that, since it is likely that Russia interfered with the referendum, a second vote is justified.
1/1	It should be so simple to make the Irish Backstop Agreement time limited. This would pass through the commons. However, it was never the intention of the EU to let Britain leave. To make a success of Brexit would undermine the whole of the EU. Therefore we will have to leave with no deal. Brexit will benefit Britain in the long term. Remainers sadly can't see beyond tomorrow.
0/0	It sounds like Brittain has the same problem the US has in this reguard: when a misinformed idiot's vote counts equally as much as a well-informed person's vote, stupid stuff happens. Sadly, the idiots vastly outnumber the intelligent, largely because politics is complicated and having a complete picture usually requires a lot of study (especially when certain media conglomerates make it their goal in life to misinform the populace). The UK gets to deal with Brexit, while the US has to sludge through the garbage dump that is Trump. Welcome to the crazy club...
0/0	It still annoys me that Britain left on the basis of lies, ignorance and bigotry.
0/0/0	It stresses the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts, but concludes: "The impact of Brexit on the UK energy system is very likely to be negative."
0/0	It struck me at the time, and still does, that the desire to leave the EU reached an almost cult-like obsession - Emotionally driven without any real regard for facts or expert opinion. It is such a shame because the EU is literally the least of our problems – As you say, it has probably been supporting the poor more than our own government.
0/0	It takes Homer Simpson to nail it: ‘What’s the point of going out? We are going to wind up back here anyway’…
1/0	It takes a man to do the job, eat your heart out Theresa May!
1/1	It the same story throughout the negotiations - they’d love to punish us....but whenever they try they realise their actions and threats badly effect themselves too. Deep down they feel we must be punished. That is their mind set. It’s what they are constantly trying to find something to bash us with that doesn’t impact them negatively too.
1/1/1	It took a man to liberate Britain from the EU tyranny.
0/0	It turns out, we like EU regulations, but we just don't want em. We're idiots.
1/0	It was a big mistake by Blair/Brown Labour to open the doors to all comers to rub the Tories noses in diversity. They rubbed their own supporters noses in it more than Tories.
1/1/1/1	It was a good idea, keep the UK strong! Youll see it is good for the long run
0/-1	It was a stupid thing to do. I don't think people understood what they were voting for.
1/1	It was a vote, done democratically, in which the minority vote is attempting to overthrow the will of the voters. They call that something, it rhymes with facism.
1	It was absolutely about immigration and EU dictatorship.
1/1	It was already voted for by the people, so why ask dumb questions like this?
0/-1	It was an elaborate con by the Tory Party to get Joe public to vote for their dumbest policy ever. Even more dumb than the poll tax.
1/1	It was an honest vote, those claiming to have voted leave but now want to stay ARE LIARS FROM REMAIN CAMP.
0/0	It was and still is a terrible idea poorly executed
0/0	It was never a good idea at any point; since this is also a point, no.
1/1	It was one of those historic days where you can honestly say that every true British person was proud to be British!
1/1	It was refreshing to see Scotland, Wales and Ireland’s flags in Parliament square instead of that vile EU dictatorship flag...
0/-1	It was shit then and it’s shit now and you’re the architect of all this shit. Will you apologise to the British public when the shit hits the fan on 29/3?
0/0	It was shit yesterday and the last time I looked it's still shit.
1/1	It was the right thing to do to leave. The EU is becoming an authoritarian bureaucracy that cares little for anything except power. They already want every member to adopt their failed currency by the year 2020.
1/1	It was the will of the people; it should be done.
1/1	It was the will of the people; it should be done. And if she can't or won't do it properly, Theresa May has got to go.
0/0/0/0	It wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
0/0	It wasn't a surprise after all, stupid people always outnumbered the clever ones, that is why politicians in every country are trying to convice them to become the herd they need.
0/0	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand
0/0	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand.
1/1	It wasn't much of a party for me, I had a quiet and very enjoyable meal with friends, and broke my dry January with a decent single malt at the same time as raising a glass to Brexit. For me there's no triumph in it though, it's a sense of overwhelming relief that the right side won. It very nearly did not win. It almost lost to a crew of the ugliest characters in modern politics, thoroughly despicable people who had long ago effectively conspired to deliver the UK to the European Single Government trussed up like a Christmas turkey. They almost won, and they haven't given up yet.
1/1/1	It will allow a change of economic model from the clapped-out neoliberalism, significant rollback from which is prohibited by the EU. Whether we seize that chance, and which model we choose, is up to us.
1/1	It will be a different relationship, but I think it can have the same benefits in terms of that free access to trade
0/0	It will be a nightmare
0/0	It will be a unattractive and small island since there is a exodo of EU and foreigners companies that will not like to pay tariffs and the complete loss of EU subsidies to the UK universities that became less attractive for investigation and development .
0/0	It will be interesting where the world will go in the coming years at this point we have two path fall in to the grip of hate or begin to fight for growing equality and start to create a better world or go back to a time where millions where killed for where they lived and what they looked like.
1/1	It will be the end of GREAT Britain if we don't leave - wish all the British people could understand that it's the most important thing in our lives right now! Transport is crippled along with every other service - we can see everything cracking around us- we all need to wake up!!!! Otherwise it's too late and we are done!
1/1	It will bounce back, this is typical market behaviour. Also no need to be so rude. Never blame those who voted, all ways those who did not!
0/0	It will get a *lot* worse if we leave
0/0	It will get even worse for those people. I did not and never would vote for a Tory government but blaming people in Brussels for decisions made in London was the height of stupidity.
0/0	It will impact not only UK and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
0/0	It will impact not only UK  and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
0/0	It will leave us poorer, due to loss of the extremely good trading terms with the EU that we have now
0/0/0	It will mean new trade friction for agriculture and manufacturing; and significant new barriers for service exports
0/0	It will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed , relocated or downsized.
1/1	It will potentially give us more control on immigration, laws etc
0/0	It will reduce the power of the UK, It will not ‘teach those politicians/bureaucrats/elitists/whoever a lesson’.
0/1	It will still be the fault of the EU for not giving us a deal. But if the EU gave us a deal, it would be the EUs fault for bullying us into that deal, not giving us a better one, and not letting us WTO. And if the EU gave us the best deal possible, that's against the will of the people and the EU are to blame.
0/0	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can’t understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea...
0/0	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can’t understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea…
1/1	It will take remainers years, if ever, to accept Brexit. They are glass half empty people. They will be scavenging for anything negative coming out of our media over the next year or two, ( and there will be plenty from our left wing remainer media), to pounce on, and crow over. They want Brexit to be a complete utter and dismal failure out of spite. Comments from them on here over the last couple of days alone, will bear this out.
0/1	It wont be when President Trump puts tarrifs on the Eu this will prove how powerful they think they are.
0/0	It would awful for EU and quite bad for UK. It gives biz-friendly examples being sometimes the only reasonable voice around. All the I numerous exports UK to EU need red-tapes as much as you need Sand in your flour. I’m against!
1/1/1/1	It would be Good if people would just give Boris a chance, time for whinging is over put your EU flags away and get behind the majority of the country
0/0	It would be a bloody stupid thing to do. I sincerely hope the British people have enough sense to kill off the idea.
1/1	It would be a great success if we get our boards back and we actually leave the EU
0/0	It would be a spectacularly self-defeating move. And nobody has the time to go through the whole process of having them come crawling back yet again just because their domestic politics is basically a kindergarden.
0/0	It would be an unmitigated disaster to leave.
0/0	It would be the saddest thing! Do not leave the EU, we all need to reform it so it works for all of us. Leaving is just a failure for nations of Europe, and giving up a great project, just because some of the politicians manage it badly.
1/1	It would be worth every penny to be free of the EU
0/1	It would have been great if you'd written this article BEFORE the Brexit Referendum, then it might have changed minds. Now it serves only to reinforce our fears of what a disastrous impact Brexit might have, given that roughly half our trade is with the EU. If, in 20 years time, trade has shrunk, and with it our economy, I wonder what they'll blame it on? The Rich? Greedy Corporations? Corrupt Politicians? or poorly informed voting behaviour? On a more positive note: my vote for salvaging some sanity is for the UK to join Canada - if they let us in, we get the advantage of Canada's free-trade agreements, but with enough control over immigration to satisfy the malingerers and the xenophobes. There's enough commonality between us and them to avoid major culture shock, and there'd be benefits on both sides. Thoughts anyone?
0/1	It would have been so much more useful if this analysis had been done BEFORE the referendum. If people had realised all the issues involved, the outcome might have been quite different. As it turned out, I think most people were only thinking about immigration and our contribution to the EU. Remember, that £300 million plus would go to the NHS. Plus there was no plan in place for leaving !!!!!
0/1/0	It'll be a cold and lonely experience. The nation has become an oxymoron - It's neither United nor Great any more - just a loose association of what could have been.
1/1	It'll be a pleasure to take our custom elsewhere. UK imports from the EU were £357 billion (53% of all UK imports). Ouch!
0/0	It'll directly affect my life so I've been watching along closely. I'm an American living in the UK and I'm married to an EU citizen. So depending on what type of deal there is (which is seeming much more likely than a no-deal at this point), it'll determine whether we stay in the country or not.
0/0	It'll harm brexiters more too, given that on average the less educated you were, the more likely you were to support brexit. The knowledge economy will absolutely leave them behind.
0/0	It'll make the UK weaker, poorer, lower their standard of living and their quality of life, limit the options avalable to UK citizens, and make the UK less influential in the world
0/0	It'll take us years to agree terms with anyone. Because if we leave other countries have the upper hand. We'll have to take whatever is being offered they know we'll be desperate. It''l take about 10 years to agree exit terms with the EU.
1/1	It's #BrexitDay - the day our great nation finally breaks free, leaves the EU and becomes a sovereign, independent, global Britain once again.
0/0	It's 2019. Shouldn't the world be pulling together instead of splintering apart? I really do despair. #fuckbrexit
1/1	It's Anglo-Saxon free thinking, common law, a free market economy and a positive outlook for me. EU statism is so miserable, demoralising and inflexible.
1/1	It's BS like this that show just how right we are to be getting out of the EU. Any club that treats members that wish to leave like this is no club that I want to be a part of.
0/0	It's OK for you, my last project was cancelled due to Brexit.
0/0	It's a bad idea to leave. The economy will collapse if we do and Britain will fall.
1/1	It's a beautiful thing.
0/-1	It's a classic case of a poorly educated electorate ,and a self-regarding society turning in on itself and navel gazing
0/0	It's a classic case of a poorly educated electorate and a self-regarding society turning in on itself and navel gazing

0/0	It's a complete joke and a mess. We get the worst of both sides.
1	It's a conspiracy!! The liberal, Hollywood media wanting to control the out come. We've not left. Yet!?
0/0	It's a dark few years ahead
1/1	It's a different language than what you here from remoaners. Crystal clear sense.
0/0	It's a economic bad decision
1/1/1	It's a economic good decision
0/0	It's a fucking travesty
1/1	It's a glorious new Britain
1/1	It's a good thing. The EU is heading in a direction that isn't good.
1/1	It's a great day for Remoaners too. They're now all free to leave the UK, the country they hate so much !! Enjoy, won't you all. I'd like to say we'll miss your mewling, but the fact is, we won't. Bye.
1/-1	It's a great day for democracy.
1/0	It's a great relief to now watch the building burn from a safe distance and not actually still be trapped inside.
0	It's a pity, but hey, f*ck off Britain, you deserve a Brexit without benefits - no solidarity goes both ways. You have been arrogant enough within the EU, time to STAY ON YOUR ISLAND, and sort it out yourself!
0/0	It's a prime example of how not to do referendums
0/0	It's a sad day. Those who voted for it will either be rich enough to survive OK .. or .. they'll be too poor to cope with the increased prices etc. Those who voted to remain as Europeans are scrabbling to find solutions; the rich will be fine of course but once again the poor will be right up against it.
0/0	It's a sad result of the bass ackwards right-shifted stab at a new era of Mercantilism. It should be put to a final public vote, and there should be a stipulation added to article 50 that countries must hold a vote to start article 50, enter a period of structuring where the country in question plans their exit strategy, without allowing any funds to be used for advertising a particular exit strategy. Following the period of deciding the strategy, it should be put under a second public vote to decide whether article 50 will continues or not. Leaving the EU isn't good for anyone, the best way to increase the standards of living is to unify intent and ideals, not unnecessarily create new divisions that weren't there before.
1/1/1	It's a scary thing to imagine my bloodline mixing with cenks.
0/0	It's a shambles.
0/0	It's a shame for the 48%, but it's the leadership of their country and their thick bigoted compatriots who are to blame.
0/0	It's a shame that I wasn't able to vote, if I was able to I would have voted to remain. As a teenager it is annoying that I cannot decide on my future. I don't think it is right that we have to rely on older people to 'decide for us'. Bizarre.
1/-1	It's a shame you can't trust anything the BBC says, look at their track record.
0/0/0	It's a shitshow in the same vein as our President, and a lot of people didn't know what they were voting for.
0/0	It's a terrible idea. Not because the EU is a good thing, because the EU is also quite bad. But because Britain is so terrible and incompetent it should never be trusted to command its own destiny as a country.
0/0	It's a total kamikaze move.
0/0	It's a typical case of not knowing what they had until it's gone :( sad situation and sad future to look forward to. It will take so much time to recover from this.....
0/0/0	It's a very clever idea, because that means you always have an excuse for the disastrous effects. They've moved their claims to be completely outside of scrutiny. I actually do feel sorry for this guy, as stupid as he was for supporting Brexit. He's had his mind poisoned by the most filthy, opportunistic liars and ended up losing everything.
0/0	It's a very very very bad idea to leave the EU. You don't think about the Britain's futur. If Britain leaves the EU the country will be lost and very little in front of the United States of America and the oders emergents countries
1/1	It's about Damn time! Jolly good! Hip hip hurray!
1/1	It's about time the power's that be !! Should realise OUT means OUT and for goodness sake just get On with it and tell junker to sling his hook !!!!!?
0/0	It's abundantly clear that the UK government is neither competent nor prepared enough to make anything other than a mess out of this given the tight deadline.
0/0	It's actually sad to see how the country is so poorly informed.
0/0	It's all downhill from here isn't it? I hope Johnson and his cabinet crash and burn along the way.
0/0	It's all just a big con job on the people, wait till we see what happens by the end of the year.
0/0	It's all ok guys, it won't cost us £7 to go to Europe. You'll just pay 10-20% more for your holiday there (on top of the 15% increase already) as the pound devalues 👌
0/0	It's all on Brexiters, now. The people who lied and propagandised for Brexit, and the people who voted for it. Still no coherent plan. I bet you wished you'd lost.
0/0	It's all smoke and mirrors BJ is a conman.
0/0	It's almost like the market wants to remain. Corbyn is totally right when he says that May has ignored what the economy wants.
0/0/0	It's almost like this whole thing was a really bad idea that no one thought through.
1/1	It's also worth pointing out that if the UK joins TPP than it will be roughly the same size as the remaining EU bloc and larger in population terms. If the US could be convinced to rejoin then it would be almost twice the size as an economic area.
1	It's always about the economy with the anti UK side which is obviously important but it can't be the only reason for staying it.
1/1	It's an absolute embarrassing thing when the EU court think they can over rule the British people. We voted out and that means out
0/0	It's an embarrassing time to be English. Fear and loathing overwhelms the poorest and least educated. The people that voted to leave were sold a lie. Dear world: don't make the same mistake we did.
1/1	It's an exciting day for the country! Now we can all come together as a nation
0/0	It's as if Brexit is a terrible idea or something.
0/0	It's bad enough I have to live with a Tory Government. I don't fancy living with an unregulated Tory Government. I value my human rights too much for that.
0/1	It's been an amazing hashtag TBH.. It's brought 10s of 000s of us pro EU ppl together here in a spectacularly short time. It's been great to not feel so alone in my daily squabbles about #Brexit 1/x
0/1	It's been three and a half days since we left the EU, surely someone out there must have encountered a benefit of brexit by now!
0/0	It's been two years, people have changed their minds. And if they haven't what would the harm be in another vote? Unless you're afraid remain will win this time.
1/1	It's been under pressure for the last 15 years under both Tory and Labour governments. The only way to regain control of our borders and enforce deportations is to leave. Britain for the British.

0/0	It's crap. Everyone in the UK loses.
0/0	It's dangerous if Brexit happens. UK is finished.
0/0	It's deeply ironic that the areas of high manufacturing in the Midlands/North that enabled Brexit to happen are the ones that will be thrown under the bus in the pursuit of Trade Deals that favour our services focussed economy.
0	It's disgusting to see that I am from a country that are filled with lunatics. It's a headache
0/0	It's disturbingly Trump-like in style and I consider it a pretty major red flag in terms of global politics
0/0	It's dumb and it doesn't feel thought through.
0/0	It's entirely May's (and Cameron's) fault that this decision has to be made now, just four months before the cliff, no options left. The UK has been in the EU for fourty years and helped shape the single market, there is no excuse for them not to know how the EU works at its core. All this time they have wasted trying to negotiate with a rulebook set in stone. They should have decided what exactly they wanted (without contradictory red lines) before triggering article 50. This crisis is completely self inflicted. May is also to blame for not preparing the country for any kind of Brexit, leaving businesses and government completely in the dark on what's going to happen, four months from the date. When one of the options includes things like food shortages and indefinitely grounded airplanes. Of course more of the blame is on Cameron who should not have made the referendum question so deceptively simple. Lots of wildly different possibilities are all grouped under "leave", it was always a given that whatever form it would eventually take would only be liked by a minority. The blame is on all of UK politics for still considering a 52-48 result valid when the Leave side was guilty of illegal campaign funding, huge lies, ties with Russia, and so on. The referendum result should have been declared invalid by Parliament. Nobody in UK politics has tried to find a compromise between the sides even though an extremely close result calls for that. But the worst are Boris Johnson, Gove, Rees-Mogg and others whose fighting for disaster Brexit for years within the Tory Party made Cameron feel there had to be a referendum in the first place. They are there for their own ego and financial gain, don't care about good government or the people and shouldn't be close to power. If no-deal Brexit happens and people die as a result, its blood on their hands.
0/0	It's far, far worse than that. Voters are refusing to acknowledge facts, facts that are very easy to verify. This isn't restricted to the Brexit debate either. It shows up with anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, climate change, Trump supporters. It's a very dangerous trend.
1/1	It's funny how the EU is actually run and basically owned by the Germans. They want to keep all in to keep them owned so to say. Koodos to the UK for breaking free from an oppressed cash and unable to sell at the price they want for what they sell to other countries. No more German rule
0/0	It's funny how the same people who want the UK to be independent from the EU, don't want Scotland to be independent from the UK.
1/-1	It's funny that they talk like EU came before Britain.
0/0	It's funny, these idiots that voted leave didn't do much research on how hard they will fall in economy it will take them years to recover.
0/0	It's going to be devastating" – here's how Brexit will screw over British touring artists
0/0	It's gonna be a close one! Company I work in has its European headquarters in London because of UK membership in EU and if BrExit really happens they already have move to Munich ready.
0/0	It's gonna be funny to watch the pound plummet, no trade deals, paperwork on imports and price rises,the u.k literally just screwed itself, who will you trade with? the e.u don't need your services
1/1/1	It's good we've gone, but we'll never know the good deal we could already have concluded if it hadn't been for all the remainiac traitors working on behalf of the EU al this time - [and I am including Theresa May in that] - one of the might have beens of history.

1/1	It's good,because England has saved 2nd world war 2 the European countries.The kingdom must act her ownself her political kingdom identity except economy cooperation with Europeans.
1/1	It's got to be the worst government, in the history of our country, absolutely Useless, it will be goodbye to most of them at the next. general Election , Plus the fact , thousands will not even bother to vote . because the referendum result to leave , they chose to ignore , ignoring the people's wishes,
1/1	It's great that they have no more globalist agenda forced down their throats!
1/1	It's great to hear that positive view of the UK. We can do it and that's why we don't need the EU. We don't need to lose any of the good laws the EU has instituted, just the bad ones and we should be able to decide for ourselves. We are a democracy and if we leave the EU what happens afterwards is down to the UK people, it's up to us to vote wisely. Better to have the power in the hands of people who understand the UK and have to live with it's policies than a group of unelected officials far removed from UK life. I'm in a similar demographic to you and it's us that really need to reach out to similar people and urge them to vote leave. We've still got time and we need everyone we can get. We haven't won until we've won.
1/1	It's heart warming to see you guys celebrating and showing pride in your country again.
0/0	It's hilarious and sad at the same time watching these people cheering about leaving EU like watching a friend who is quickly eating hamburger with super hot sauce without thinking what's gonna happen next
0/0	It's hilarious that the colored folks in UK voted for Brexit. Those idiots didn't realize brexit is all about pro-white movement.
1/0/-1	It's inherently unstable, it has to keep improving or it'll end.
0/-1	It's interesting... I hope it works out for you guys. I honestly thought that you all would have another year until you left. To be honest I have my doubts about this. I'm afraid for your economy, your NHS, and Northern Ireland.  But I'm truly rooting for you guys! Just maybe worried.
1/0	It's just amazing to see what fear mongering can do. Look at the youth here in the US, a bunch of dumbed down kids who think the almighty government must do everything for them, and we need to keep our borders open because the people of the world should be one. Now it's all over the UK, kids who think that since their nation isn't part of a union run by globalist elites, that their country will crumble. WRONG! Britain was once a dominant world power and a trade hub. It can be that again! No wonder people hate this generation. Everyone everywhere thinks that everything should be done for them, and nobody wants to get their hands dirty and do it for themselves. Absolutely disgusting.
1/1	It's just scaremongering. We'll be ok, we're British! Rule Britannia!
0/1	It's kind of ironic that back in the day the usa celebrated its independence from the uk now some 244 years later things are reversed.the uk will celebrate its dependence to usa.
0/1	It's like a crazy ex threatening suicide if you don't give them what they want. Gotta call their bluff.
0/0/0	It's like chopping off your arm after googling symptoms for the rash on it
1/1	It's like leaving a bad marriage you happy it's all over!
0/0	It's like someone wanted to simulate the confusion and [shortages](https://apnews.com/3a9d922f6fb14049af6c0abe042f316f) of war without the shooting. It's like an inverse Dunkirk evacuation.
0/0	It's like the people who voted for brexit didn't think it through.
0/0/0/0	It's literally like shooting one's self in the foot. Dumb AF
0/0	It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
1/0	It's no surprise that Boris's sense of 'can do' is appreciated by voters frustrated by the tricks and shenanigans of a Remainer-dominated Parliament that declines to honour the outcome of the referendum.
1/1	It's not EU that has kept the peace in Europe, it is NATO: @LouiseBoursUKIP. @bbcquestiontime Well said.
1/1	It's not about immigration etc, at the end of the day its about SOVEREIGNTY
1/1	It's not about money, it's about freedom.
0/0	It's not bad news, it's the best chance of stopping Brexit.
1/1	It's not going to be that bad lol the government wouldn't allow it otherwise so just sit back and chill :)
0/0	It's not going to happen, simply because it can't. There's no structures in place to handle such a thing. Just look at this fact: the UK imports 70% of its food. Now tell me, how would you expect to sit at a negotiating table after brexit and have a fair negotiation with any powerful country knowing this fact? You need them to feed yourself! Its like arguing with your parents while living at their expense, you can say what you want but in the end we know who gets to decide.
1/1	It's not so much that Brexit or Trump are good for working people, it's that the EU and the globalist neoliberal project in general is spectacularly bad for workers.
1/1	It's not so much we don't want to integrate or work with Europe, we just don't want to be in the European Union and they're not the same thing. The EU is an ugly Neo-con, anti-democratic, chronically corrupt institution with a long term gain of a federal Europe, at the mercy of big corporates and private interest groups. In the UK people think that they'll look after our interests above our own government. But a quick look at Greece and Spain shows that they'll asset strip and privatize as their banking masters want. There is no European public. There are still separate national publics, and there surely will be for as far ahead as we can see. This creates a paradise for lobbyists, who can (and do) act unhindered by media or public scrutiny to influence the places where real power lies in Brussels, that is with the commission and within the even-more-secretive council. The logic of the EU, if it is ever to be democratised, is to become a United States of Europe. The euro is a Trojan horse to achieve this goal of fiscal and political union. Either one needs to be a federalist, or one needs to ditch the EU. Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn and the rest are trying to have it both ways. It’s an unstable halfway house, and will fail, as in effect the euro has already failed. The EU will fail within 10-15 years, we need to get out now!
0	It's not the 'UK' it's our voting system that's retarded.. once all these bitter old fuckers who think they're ode something die we'll come back.. Just probably with a worse off deal
1/1	It's not the polls that count, it's where you put your X on Thursday. Save our Country from the Dictatorship of the EU. For DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE Vote LEAVE.
1/1	It's not what big business want, it's what the British people voted for and that was to leave the EU!
1/1	It's not working due to none of the elites wanting it to work.
1/1	It's official! BREXIT Jan 30, 2020!!! A historical day
0/0	It's official: Brexit Britain is a laughing stock.
0/0	It's ok that we voted Brexit, because now we've exposed the 52% of Britain that have single digit IQ's
1/1	It's ok to be a brexiteer.
1/1	It's only as people are non believers.what will they say when Britain gets better
1/1	It's only the idiots that are holding up our leaving that are making it a farce, leaving the EU is the best thing to happen to Britain since we joined it.
0/0/0	It's only the start and the possibility of a happy outcome is very unlikely.
1/1	It's over. The film has finished, the audience is filing out, but still the Remain trolls refuse to leave their seats.
1/1	It's painful to watch .. No one voted for a REMAIN deal..
0/0	It's painful to watch. The UK government has completely failed to do their jobs on th emost basic level
0/0	It's painfully ironic that a country that never cared for the borders of other countries during it's imperialistic era and specialized in murdering, pillaging, abusing and stealing resources of other countries now has a primary concern about it's BORDERS loooool.
0/0	It's pointless trying to twist Brexit to make it fit, it ain't going to work.
0/1	It's pretty obvious now that about the only people who want Brexit are either dim or troll army operatives.
0/0	It's pretty simple what we voted for. We want to live in the EU. We don't understand how can anyone not want to live in the EU?! And now we lost, we are both angry at being dragged out of the EU against our will and even more at the prospect of the country we love being shattered into many pieces over this issue.
0/0	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century
0/0/0/0	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century. History will judge it harshly.
0/0	It's provable reality that Brexit is a huge mistake
0/-1/0	It's quite funny seeing some running from European Union, some are waiting to get into it.
1/-1	It's really difficult for us to change our tariffs to prevent manufacturers in other countries from simply finding loopholes to get around our tariffs.
1/1	It's really easy for champagne socialists in the South, in places like Bath and Bristol, to label Northerners as racist. Being at uni taught me that some Southerners are all for multiculturalism and more immigration, mainly because it doesn't affect them. Coming from such a white, middle class background means that they are so privileged and are so pretentious because non of the down-sides of EU membership affect them. Of course they want to remain it means that Daddy's company will do better and be able to hire cheap immigrant labour without filling out much paperwork.
0	It's shit show, but it's their shit show....it's not like we don't have one of our own.
0/1	It's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship
1/1	It's simple the UK needs to leave the EU and take care of the British people first.
0/0	It's simple, brexit will effect the EU negatively but the UK will be worse off.
1/0	It's so famous for being probrexit that it's even started a turn of phrase for all those dizzy shouty red faced old gents who believe anger makes up for lack of knowledge.
0/0	It's so funny that many of the Brexit voters were running to get residency in the EU before Brexit. It's like they don't understand laws can be changed to send them back to the island
1/1	It's so simple. We leave with no deal on article 24 on WTO terms with no tariffs until a deal is sorted.
0/0	It's the first day of your nightmare british people.
1/-1	It's the knock on effect for some other countries this will have
0/1	It's the most full of rage I've got over anything for a long time. These people are ruining my country and for what? Nobody has even come CLOSE to defining a single realistic benefit to Brexit. All it's doing is turning the UK into an irrelevant, hate filled island that the rest of the world is laughing at.
0/-1	It's the other way around too. A mate of me is from UK and spent all his adult life in EU. So uncertain too what will happen now
0/0	It's the single most dumb thing you could do
1/1	It's the start of a brave new "Brexit" world. Looking forward not back.
0/0	It's the year 2819. Today we celebrate the annual 'Brexit extension'. Noone really knows where this tradition comes from, nor what the term 'brexit' means, but as part of the festivities the dumbest man that can be found is given all the power and a blonde wig. Later when the celebrations are over the youths have to clean up the utter mess left behind.
1/1	It's time for everyone to be independent. This was supposed to happen last year. Get ready fot the market to crash. The world is going to make a major change in a few years.
0/0	It's time to #Brejoin!
1/1/1	It's time to restore true democracy & that is why I am voting to leave the EU on June 23rd.
0/0	It's time to stop brexit
0/0	It's too bad you can't force the architects of this disaster to see things through to the end and not be able to just resign.
0/-1	It's treachery against the British people by an untrustworthy government disgraceful
1/1	It's true, it can be the small things in life that can bring you joy, I voted Leave, and seeing Remaoners trying to overturn a democratic vote does bring a smile on a daily basis...
0/0	It's unbelievable this Friday the UK will leave the EU because of 1,269,501 votes. What's even more disturbing is the less than 70% voter turnout in the remain areas of England vs the 70% and over turnout in areas that voted leave. Most remain areas like Liverpool, Manchester, and London with massive populations had only 65% - 68% turnout. How different things would be with an extra 5% - 10% remain voter support. All the EPL clubs voted remain along with the financial center of the entire island yet no intelligent concession was made for these sectors that provide 80% of the UK GDP. Something is seriously wrong with Westminster and I completely understand Scotland's necessity to look out for its own future.
1/1	It's undemocratic. None of the peoples of Europe have voted in a party that had as its manifesto "we will dissolve our nation into a superstate". Certainly not the UK, anyway.
0/0	It's unfair to say "we", a great number of people are against crashing out.
1/1	It's very simple for me, at this point I pretty much tune out the arguments put forth on the economy and immigration, it's more about the ceding of powers do a foreign controller. You can say what you will about the extent to which it does control our laws but the issue is that it does at all. We joined for an economic union, then the referendum happened and we were promised no political union, then in the 90's they said fuck that and went head long into the creation of the European superstate. What irritates me more is when I see people arguing something a long the lines of "The European Union does awesome stuff too and this and that.", I do not care. I'm English and more than that British, not European, there may be lessons to be learned sure but I am not a European citizen, I am a British Citizen, I don't care how big your pot of gold I'm not shitting on the Magna Carta a year after it's eight hundredth anniversary. I also hear people blathering on about how the EU has maintained peace in Europe; absolute bollocks - Nato has maintained peace in Europe, the EU nowadays seems to be desperate to taunt Russia and prove that it's a "big boy" now. I see an underhanded and unbelievably incremental and slow but very evidently there, degradation of the powers of the UK. Also the lies at every turn, Nigel Farage (the crazy horrible badman that is a fearmongerererer and a nasty xenophobe) pointed out a few years ago about the future creation of a European Army that had been discussed and just how terrible an idea it was. No, absolutely not, we would NEVER build a European army. Fast forward a few years and now there is one being openly discussed like it's the best idea since sliced bread. Oh no! Tis but the border force! Equipped with all the latest tanks and fighter aircraft and naval fleets to deal with those pesky... Erm... Border jumpers? There is also the rumour of the removal of Article 50 so there would never be another chance to peacefully leave and this worried me greatly. The way I see it is this, Voting to Remain has appealed to people I think in part because of an attitude of "I'm not going to be scared into leaving!" which is funny because it's pretty much the same mentality on the other side for, all of big business and the media coming out to say we should remain makes you feel a little like you're being fear mongered to. It seems that to vote to remain is the future (next 40 years) dissolution of the UK as a sovereign nation, and the vote to leave (harrowing a journey it may be) will lead to us at the very least being able to fuck up on our own or prosper on our own. As we should do. Just a quick note for the word twister's out there, I'm not meaning some pseudo-hermit kingdom. Normal trade with the world like the world does anyway, without an (increasingly infectious) political union.
1/1	It's what people voted for. This is democracy in action.
1/1	Italian MEP has hit the nail squarely on the head. The EU us a mafia style racket and is the modern face of European Fascism. The conduct of the EU over Brexit has revealed the true nature of the German dominated EU Empire
1/1	Italians supporting Brexit ! god bless UK ! keep being master of your fate
1/1	Italy and france will likely to follow england soon..
1/1	Italy going into recession soon they can't pay off the interest of it's debt because it's economy as stopped growing and a few other EU countries are heading the same way it's time to leave now
1/1	Its a very very easy decision, and we are finally being allowed it! OUT OUT OUT!
0/-1	Its actually embarrassing watching them play at being macho.
0/0	Its actually sick, I see the poorest and most destitute people in the UK gloating on facebook about the tory victory while their public services crumble around them. Complete insanity.
1/1	Its actually the EU who have created the so-called "crisis" because they don't want the UK to leave. If the EU would allow trade talks, a trade deal could remove the need for customs entirely
1/1	Its all about Politics versus common sense. If the EU want to cut their nose off to spite their face its up to them.
1/1	Its all good - we're leaving No Deal bye bye EU dictators !
0/1	Its all just talk, talk, talk. They want to set an example to other members that leaving is too costly and too hard.. They will fail as the system becomes more stained and fails to function.
1/1	Its all mental - Leaving the EU will create the opportunity for a MASSIVE economic boom in the UK. I think most people have stopped buying into all the 'fear' .....its going to be amazing.
0/0	Its always the EUs fault, If we crash out on WTO rules it will be the EUs fault. The incompetence of brexiteers never gets touched on.
0/0	Its amazing that one of the pillar members of the EU has convinced a plurality of its population that the EU is the reason for it's problems and has now left it in such a way. My admiration of the British people and their government has been greatly diminished by these actions from the last 4 years
0/0	Its amazing to see that there is so huge class difference in the UK. People left on their own... Fighting to survive day after day. Its like in US. This is not European spirit. This is predatory capitalism. Few have more than they will ever need while the rest is living of the scraps. Leaving EU is just going to make things worse, but it's obvious that no-one cares about the future of UK.
0/-1	Its amuses me that uk which invaded lots of countries for their own good now against immigration. UK is really a very conservative country. I think trump supporters are better than the uk citizens.😶
1/1/1	Its astonishing that some people still having allegiance with EU. For God sake stand up for your own nation once.
1/1	Its because europe banned memes So.... Im happy i guess
1/1	Its best for Britain to be in control of Britain just like its best for the US to be in control of the US. Death to globalism.
1/1	Its better than Papa EU
0/0	Its crazy how stupid people are. These brexiters are like the maga turds here in the states.
0/-1	Its damaging and really needs to be stopped going to far now
0/0	Its depressing especially for northerners. Liverpool as a city was given so much for capital of culture, the entire of Merseyside benefits so much yet you get ignorant racists wanting to leave just cos immigrants stealing muh jobs
1/1	Its going to be fantastic after 47 years in prison!
0/0	Its going to be like a Divorced couple living in the same house.
0/0	Its good thing, ENGLAND leaves the EU. See what i did their? ENGLAND. Cause Scotland and Northern-Ireland will join the EU in the future. So "great britain" will be no more. I lolled so hard. Ukip leaders leaves, Boris leaves, Labour in shambles, ... It will be good for european to shop in webshops in the UK, now the pounds sacks. And lets not forget: if ENGLAND wants to have some foothold onto EU market, they have to pay MILLIONS of POUNDS to the EU to get acces to it. if not: good luck finding another 500 000 000 costumers market.
1	Its just pure basic common sense to be able to control who is allowed to live in your country. It doesnt matter what race they are or where they come from, the problem is the number and the quality.
0/-1	Its like as if EU is the sensible parent that helps its stupid kid.
1/1	Its not Brexit that we should be celebrating. Far more important is returning democracy to the people.
1/-1	Its not difficult, but the multinationals will oppose it at every turn.
0	Its not too late to reverse Brexit.
1/1	Its only one vote for me and that is for UK to leave the European Circus.
1/1	Its our traitors that need to be eliminated first.Them the EU and then Islam .Busy times ahead folks..
1/1/1	Its sad and a little scary that the British people, who democratically voted to leave the EU, are being held hostage by an incompetent/corrupt Parliament and EU.
0/0	Its sad that the majority was deluded enough to think brexit was a good thing.
1/1	Its simple what we want. To LEAVE!
1/1	Its simple, we dont like being controlled by a bunch of foreign bureaucrats.
0/0	Its the UK who are the bullies. The EU have not changed their position in over 2 years - its our government who changes its mind.
1/1	Its the other unmentionable that needs keeping out.
1/-1	Its the working class that have been shafted time and time again and will risk anything just for a change.
0/0	Its time to say " STOP BREXIT

0/-1/-1	It’s a few steps back
0/0	It’s a fucking stupid thing thing the U.K. did, a shit deal and they’d have been better off voting Remain. Absolutely no positives to it. None.
1/1	It’s a momentous day. One in which Britain finally brings to an end a ghastly experiment that’s brought us nothing but suffering. At midnight, I urge us all to celebrate our freedom with riotous jubilation. Finally, the hell is over.
0/0	It’s a ploy, a very stupid ploy, but what can you expect from a government of lazy know nothing incompetents.
1/1	It’s a sham! Pushed up prices everywhere bad for lazy tourism and especially puts up food prices….has huge waste and very inefficient a laugh considering it’s German run…owned….it’s a dictatorship hub
1/1	It’s a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer’s no.
0/0	It’s a tragedy.
0	It’s about Europe’s balance UK not to leave eu… Eu was made to avoid wars by creating a balance of France,Germany and England!!! Brexit will be dangerous!!!
0/0	It’s about people angry at the world changing around them when they have no interest in keeping up with the change. Globalisation is out of the hat. It’s not going back in no matter how hard they try. They might succeed for 2-3-5 years but the works will inevitably carry on evolving into the global village
1/1	It’s about time some reality was put into our dealings with the EU. Their untenable belief that we desperately need to cling on to their coat tails is based on remoaner angst and encouragement. They need to understand that a trade deal is neither essential or desperately required. I do hope they are listening.
0/0	It’s all madness! Whatever we agree to, whatever we negotiate - customs union, single market, whatever - we will never be better off out than in. Most of our politicians have totally lost sight of reality.
0/0	It’s all making me 80s nostalgic. Just need the forthcoming mass unemployment and we will be back where we started!
1/1	It’s all very well and good, but would you trust anything that comes from the EU ?
1/1	It’s already difficult to get things done with the normal levels of government without another one governed by 27 other nations and their levels of government.
0/0/1	It’s at this point, now that it’s too late, that Brexiters finally realise that those charged with driving the bus to the sun lit uplands are all asleep at the wheel.
1/-1	It’s back to the Belgae for you soon Brutus and no more of this shit !
1/1	It’s because we know in our bones that it is a daft way to run a whole continent
0/0	It’s been Putin’s plan all along, to undermine democracies, the EU and NATO ... and it’s been working fab here in the US and over there now. Yet he couldn’t have done it without solid participation from so many of us ... let’s hope this darkness lifts soon.
1	It’s beyond my comprehension why nation or citizen of any nation would want someone other then their elected officials to make laws and dictate how a country is run..
1/1	It’s called “Self Determination” “Independence” “Freedom”. Great Britain was very successful and wealthy as their own Country ... before the EU.
1/-1	It’s done. Today we will finally leave the EU. #BrexitDay
0/0	It’s funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine.
0/0	It’s funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine. Yeah, but there were no computers and smartphones, we were just fine as well. Imagine if all computers broke today, I’m sure it will cause panic. But are human beings going to extinct because of this? No, but is it going to cause chaos? Definitely. If we want to lower the bar for living as to survive, I’m sure British people would do just fine.
1/1	It’s great that Brits are getting their country back!
0/0	It’s have to be considering we’re two months away from seeing an entire country get fucked
0/0	It’s horrifying to see everything we knew Brexit would cause happening in front of our eyes - thousands of jobs going abroad, failure of investment, total absence of trade framework.Brexit reality #LetsJustStopIt
1/1	It’s insulting to hear this news presenter say it’s not likely Britain will become America’s 51st state. Its ignorant insults like that which will make Britain a success. You really underestimate my country.
0/0	It’s interesting to hear Leavers proclaiming that we are now "freed from the EU shackles" yet fail to understand that the UK is now in "vassalage" to the EU for the rest of the year and possibly longer!
0/0	It’s just delayed- we’ll be back in the EU within ten years, so what’s your point? Brexit will fail, and this experiment will prove once and for all that we are better off inside the EU- albeit next time on worse conditions, with the Euro, no rebate, no Scottish oil and gas to siphon off etc.
0/0	It’s mad that 17 odd million can decide the fate for the rest of the 50 odd million who either were too young to vote, didn’t vote or voted no…
0/-1	It’s merely the first steps down a very long path.
0/0/0	It’s no wonder Downing Street has told some of these clowns to do one
0/0	It’s not arrogance to suggest that only Remainers can think straight. Evidence-based research, backed up with independent verifiable rock solid data shows that our Remoaner thought processes did not lead to the ongoing, ahem, very damaging and expensive shambles!
1/1	It’s not difficult, we voted to leave, so let’s leave and then we will know how it goes, neither the EU or the UK favour no deal, so let’s have a deal or we go
1/1	It’s not the people of Europe we dislike it’s the corrupt EU commission and the EU superstate project.
0/-1	It’s nothing to do with brexit if you read the article you idiot, it has made consistent losses since it opened in 2007
0/0	It’s official, I now officially hate the way this country is. Activism Time.
0/0	It’s ok. Britain just don’t ask for German tax payers money when you have problems. Thanks
0/0	It’s probably only ironic to anybody who thought Brexit would be good for the U.K. Everybody else knew this would happen.
0/0	It’s quite funny how the Brexiters are STILL , trying to CONVINCE THEMSELVES - they did the - ‘right thing ‘ !
0/0/0	It’s quite simple really, if you have a young family and care about the future economic worth of the country vote to stay in the EU. If you don’t care about the future and just want go make sure you have money in your own pocket and say fcuk future generations than vote to get out.
0/0	It’s remarkable that so many people genuinely believe Brexit is done and dusted. To those people I say show me what has changed when I wake up tomorrow morning. Everyone else can look forward to at least 12 more months (more like a few years) of wrangling about a trade deal in which we will come out losers, either because we couldn’t agree a deal or because we make stupid decisions on things like fishing.
0/0	It’s ridiculous. It will completely destroy the country. No deal is worse tbf.
0/0/0	It’s so sad watching conned gullibles waving their little flags in the misguided belief they’ve ‘won’ something.
0/0/0	It’s so silly because I’m going to be affected from this deal the most as of my age and I couldn’t even vote. If all my age group got to vote their would be no brexit without a doubt.
0/0	It’s so weird to see that people are celebrating their mistake.
0/0	It’s striking how many lies the Brexiters are still telling. Lying about a trade deal, the trade-offs involved, the EU’s position, the transition. Even with an 80 seat majority and having achieved their Brexit. What does that say about their confidence in their own project?
0/0	It’s the 1st of February and day one in the countdown towards the collapse of Brexit
1/1	It’s the EU that will implode when we leave without a deal and they go bust.
0/0	It’s the UK government that is threatening to ’crucify’ Ireland and the EU that is trying to protect our peace agreement.
0/1	It’s time to go back to the people and decide what they want to proceed with - they have seen the lies by politicians and have heard the disruption Brexit will cause. Let’s let them make a final decision.
0	It’s time to turn up the heat on the EU by accelerating our post Brexit trade talks. The penny has finally dropped
1/1	It’s time we were finally liberated.
1/1	It’s time.
1/0	It’s unfortunate that the United Kingdom despises Europe but at least it will be leaving very soon.
0/0/0	It’s utterly idiotic. I’m astonished how many people just don’t get why it’s a terrible idea.
1/0	It’s what we voted for
0/-1	It’s “proved” nothing yet - no right or wrong. The UK will now have to prepare itself efficiently, sow new opportunity, harvest it, then sustainably and fairly distribute the bounty. We’ll see I guess.....
1/1	I think even the shrillest, most unreconciled "Remoaner" would concede that this assertion is factually false.
0/0	I would have voted to stay - purely for selfish reasons (stability keeping £ stronger and I like the option to live and work in Europe without visa).
1/1	I´m brazilian and I live in Brasil. I support brexit.
0/0	I’d argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it’s very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it’s hard to come to a consensus.
0/0	I’d argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it’s very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it’s hard to come to a consensus. Plans come together based on objective positions based on data to gain agreement, there isn’t a strong data driven argument for leaving hence Brexit supporters can’t form a plan, it’s all emotional IMO.
0/0	I’d just like to point out that within the next couple of months the EU is bringing in a law that makes it illegal for big companies to avoid paying their taxes.
0/-1	I’d much prefer you embraced a starving rabid polar bear instead.
0/1	I’ll happily spend the day after #brexit smacking the smug smirks off the swivelled-eyed brexidiots. I’ll start with my family first.
0/0	I’m 17 but turn 18 in four days. This morning I’ve woken up to feel completely betrayed by my own country. One thing that upsets me most is that this decision has been made by people who will not have to live with the consequences for as long as us. Young people voted to remain and older people voted to leave. I feel that I have been let down by an older generation who won’t be affected by the volatility of this decisions.
0/0	I’m British and I struggle with Brexit!
0/0	I’m British and now depressed
0/0/1	I’m a 20-year-old student in Scotland. Although originally from London I’ve lived most of my life in France, where my parents moved when I was young. I consider myself European rather than British or English or Scottish. I strongly supported the Better Together side in the Scottish independence referendum, but today I would rather live in an independent, but European Scotland, than a UK broken off from Europe. In the immediate few weeks, I intend to make good on my pledge to myself to claim German nationality to retain European citizenship, as I am eligible for it as a descendant of refugees of Nazism to Britain. I’m shocked that my grandparents, refugees themselves, voted leave to curb immigration.
0/0	I’m a Remainer. But even I accept the result . But I will say may your god help us
1/1	I’m a brexit supporter (don’t kill me) and I still found this hilarious.
0/-1	I’m a democrat and I say as soft as possible or remain
0/0	I’m anti-Brexit but I can see no Brexit link here. If you simply blame Brexit on everything bad, you’ll dilute and mask the real effects of Brexit.
0/0	I’m ashamed to be British. We are officially a laughing stock, divided, leaderless and if that represents our political spectrum and clergy, I’m emigrating.
1/1	I’m celebrating Britain’s Independence Day!
1/1	I’m celebrating with our brethren across the pond tonight. What a great victory for Liberty! Cheers from America!
1/1	I’m completely done with them and will never again waste my time voting, especially when my vote counts for nothing. We voted for leave not a deal!
0/0	I’m confused. It was voted for by the majority of the country within a very slim margin. Your parliament can’t seem to agree on a plan to move forward all these years later. There have been 2 prime ministers and now an election that will influence the representation in parliament and Brexit. And you all are just standing by watching as pending non-EU citizens. Is that kind of right ?
0/0	I’m convinced that this shameful blip in our long history will only be temporary
0/-1	I’m curious to see if their economy tanks
0/0	I’m disgusted. Utterly and completely disgusted with my country and what they have done to my future. I’m 16 years old and therefore didn’t vote on this matter, which incidentally I’m also absolutely furious about. The fact that people who are going to be gone in the next 10 years were allowed to vote on something that my peers and I have to live with for the rest of our lives is completely and utterly unacceptable. I’m disgusted with the way the campaigns have been carried out and the fear-mongering that has taken place. I’m disgusted that this country are so fearful of immigration and the outside world they would cut themselves off entirely from any connections we may previously have had. But most of all, I’m scared. I’m terrified. I’m terrified for my future, and what that may bring. I’m terrified that we live in a country of racists and bigots and that young people will have to live with their mistakes. I’m terrified that we are governed by a group of disgusting, rightwing, racist trolls who couldn’t care less about what young people have to say. I’m terrified that this is the country I live in, and this is the choice that they have made.
0/0	I’m done with it. Done with caring and trying to make my country a better place. People were lied to and they took it in.
0/0	I’m embarrassed and ashamed to be english today! After seeing the respect given to us by Europe for leaving the EU then seeing the uneducated, immature white trash of the uk celebrating and gloating that we “have our freedom” that don’t have a clue what it means.
0/0/0	I’m fed up with the never ending #Brexit mess. Why don’t they just call it off and get on with solving real problems
1/1	I’m from North America and I love watching British parliament in action not the boring CSPAN no one watches
0/1/1	I’m glad they made it out.
1/0	I’m hoping we rejoin before my passport runs out!
1/1	I’m just happy we’re leaving and there’s nothing which can stop it now.
1/1	I’m just happy we’re leaving and there’s nothing which can stop it now. I love how much it annoys remainers. I’m not racist because I don’t care what colour someone is. It’s not their choice. I have no problems with anyone of a different sexual orientation to me cause it’s doesn’t effect me in anyway nor is it even there choice. I don’t care what religion someone follows. I have gay friends, black friends, white friends, Arabian friends and Indian friends. All of them where brought up in Britain, they sound British, they eat British things, they hold British values, they are British. If someone wants to live here they need to abandon anything which isn’t in line with our culture including their language. Don’t care if you French , American, Brazilian, Korean, Syrian, Nigerian or Australian. You integrate your self in our country. It’s a privilege not a right to live here
0/0	I’m not a UK citizen but I really can’t see any way this is a net benefit.
0/0	I’m not afraid with a no-deal Brexit. GB looses, EU doesn’t.
1/1	I’m not british myself, but I do hope England (we shouldn’t make assumptions about the Scotts) leaves the EU. They are a constant source of imperialist arrogance and are an obstacle to greater integration. These are the people that are the forefathers of rampant capitalism, exploitation of workers, material and cultural collonialism, inventors of poor laws and work houses and who are more worried about corporate interests than the prosperity of citizens.
0/1	I’m not in the slightest bit downbeat about stopping Brexit. We are going to have a people’s vote because they, the Leave establishment, lied to us. Let’s bin the whole thing and fix the real problems in this country.
1/-1	I’m not sure if Brexit will be a success but today is, on balance, a good day for democracy and trust in politicians.
1/1	I’m old enough to remember articles saying our civil service was so good that within a couple of years of being in the Common Market they’d all be eating out of our hands and Britain would be top dog in Europe! I don’t give any credence to the notion of us undermining from within. Staying in would carry on creating too many beneficiaries of EU largesse - expenses, security jobs, consultancies, advisors, lobbyists, media companies. I respect remainers but time has moved on. Leave now, and stay cheerful, folks!
1/1	I’m pretty sure most sane people understand. The UK Brexiter’s understood that their membership was important to the EU as a host to the parasitic countries expecting to be lifted up by sucking to money out of the UK.
0/0	I’m right wing and I voted out, but now I know that was a bad mistake, stocks won’t recover as FT has reported through fetchreport.
1/1	I’m so excited for the future surely now we are going to be the country we once was! Independent self-governing country! I love Europe and all the people that are in it you are welcome but we don’t want no criminals we’ve got enough over here as it is haha I love Europe but hate the European Union! Rule Britannia..... Britain shall never be slaves......
0/0	I’m so relieved about Brexit, Boris just said there will still be mars bars and water! All that worry over nothing!
0/0	I’m sorry for my british friends, but I really hope UK doesn’t get his way in the trade talks. The more UK suffers the more people will realise that globalisation, free trade and unity are essential for investment, jobs and prosperity
1/0	I’m staying well away from the Brexit celebrations tonight. The stench of Lynx Africa and John Player Specials will be fucking toxic #BrexitCelebration
0/0/0	I’m still waiting for someone to outline one single benefit of leaving the Eu
1/1	I’m sure there WILL be teething troubles. But it’s a small price to pay for freedom!
0/0	I’m surprised that Bonehead Johnson has decried “Mumbo-Jumbo”. He displayed a particular skill in that respect during the Brexit campaign
0/0	I’m working class and on benefits for mental health issues and I know if Brexit goes ahead I’m gonna be one of the first people to feel the effects. I’m just constantly living with anxiety over the whole thing.
0/0	I’ve always thought that however you voted we all had our reasons and opinions based on the information at hand. But anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it’s wrong. There has to be reasons why people like Mogg are fighting for this to happen and those reasons won’t be for the good of you and me. #stopbrexit
1/-1	I’ve arrived in Westminster and this guy isn’t in a magnanimous mood
0/0	I’ve had the great fortune in my life to have huge flexibility to live abroad in the EU and experience new cultures. Today is a sad day for me as such opportunities going forward for others will now be more limited. I find that a shame as that’s how I’ve grown the most. #brexit
1/-1	I’ve met loads of remoaner racists. Also met leavers who are racist but my experience has been more remain than leave.
0/1	I’ve seen arguments that view Brexit almost as a protest vote against the EU and some of their protectionist policies, and I think there are some solid arguments there. But really Brexit just abandons any say the UK would have in the EU and any power to change those policies, while making the lives of its citizens generally worse.
1/1	I’ve voted brexit and I would vote brexit again and again and again and again I’m twenty plus and proud to be English and I’m not a 70 year old pensioner
1/1	JAPAN.... Out of the EU and a prospering island nation, we should use them as inspiration.
1/1	JOHNSON AND TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE WORLD 👍👍
1/1	JUST BLOODY LEAVE AND STOP THIS PI***NG ABOUT. 31 BLOODY MONTHS and we are talking about ANOTHER 12 SODDING MONTHS. MARCH 29th IS WHEN WE LEAVE, SO FFS LEAVE IT AT THAT.
1/1	JUST LEAVE!
1/-1	Jacob effortlessly dismantles all his opposition, it's quite beautiful.
1/1	Janet, thank you for this insight. You are correct. We have a bumpy road ahead for a while, but like you, after doubt at times that we would not succeed, I am deeply thankful that the majority in this nation have, in spite of 45 years of attempted indoctrination by the EU, retained their individuality and free spirited attitude. We are not for turning.
0/0	Japan has a huge whisky industry. If Japan enjoys a comprehensive FTA with the EU, and the UK leaves the EU and Single Market, the Scottish Whisky industry will suffer huge losses throughout the EU.
0/0/0	Jason, I'm a remainer and I voted to maintain freedom of movement and a stronger Europe, I voted for our children's future in a secure and stable block with shared values and standards.
0/0	Jesus fcukin H Christ!, this is the kind of things dictators like Trump do, solve a problem by banning officials from talking about it. Let’s also not forget that Johnson has advised people to ignore the BBC and is trying to prevent access for news agencies that decry his actions!
0/-1	Jesus wept
1/1/1	Job done. The UK is out, the rest is just details.
1/1	Job done. Vote out!
1/1	Jog on you lefty tossers! The EU is dead and they just haven't figured it out yet.
1/-1/-1	John Curtis polls voters about certain Eu regulations. Turns out voters like them.
0/0	Johnny Foreigner's point of view I've been working in the UK for some years. I needed to seek a medical attention only once, in five years - a sprained wrist due to a bike accident. While I've been contributing into the NHS since the day one. I have never been unemployed for longer than ten days, or have received a single penny of benefits or any support. I pay tax and national insurance as everyone else who's legally employed. Regarding the NHS situation: Fewer migrants won’t necessarily mean shorter A&amp;E queues when migrants are more likely to be in A&amp;E as doctors and nurses than as patients. Don't blame the immigrants, they do come to fill a gap on market, they do take jobs that no one else is willing to do anyway. It's not a poor immigrants fault that incompetent governments or councils haven't invested enough into the housing and schools. Especially during a "good years" when the economy has been flourishing, underpinned by the influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe after the 2004. What's the worst outcome apart from economic stagnation and uncertainty - The voices of bigoted, racist primitives became loud and confident. What they used to dare to say only in their living rooms, they can say on the street, in a bus or at work now. I witnessed it personally that before 2016 people have been much more careful not to be nasty to anyone, hiding it behind politeness. They've simply dropped all the pretence. No wonder, Murdoch's press have done an amazing job pitching hate and lies.
0/0	Johnson & Tories know what a crock Brexit is & when the pain starts to be felt, they will need a sustained anti EU media message to cement their propaganda
1/1	Johnson 's finest. These are his people. This is what supporters of the #NotFitForOffice UK government's flagship
0/0	Johnson 'vision' will crash UK's economy
0/0	Johnson admits in public to being a sociopath. And I am unsurprised.
0/-1	Johnson also relies on a gullible and stupid population, let's not beat around the bush Brexit couldn't have succeeded otherwise.
0	Johnson and Javid order budget cuts of at least 5% The money used to get Brexit over the line is running out + they know tax revenues are falling.
0/-1	Johnson and the Brexiters hoping the country can come together to make Brexit a success. Hahaha, 50+ per cent of the population, mostly the educated ones, want nothing to do with it. Brexit is a Tory project, you own it.
0/0	Johnson clearly stated to all, he does not address difficult questions. He did not do the difficult interview. He refused to face a tv chat with one of his greatest fans, Piers Morgan. His ability to negotiate anything is zero. What he is good at is acting like a cheeky boy, with ruffled hair, spouting out nationalist jargons to appeal to masses & lying. You voted him PM. What did you expect?
0/0/1	Johnson could have tried to heal the divisions. Instead he’s preparing the ground to blame #EU once #Brexit damage is clear & he's been found out by the masses who voted for him. #BrexitLies
0/0	Johnson has claimed that a comprehensive trade agreement can be done quickly and has vowed to make Brexit a success. Barnier has claimed that the transition period is to short for a major deal and that Brexit is bad for both parties. If there is no deal and the economy tanks, who will look stupid? Who will therefore be desperate?
0/0	Johnson is a charlatan and a liar. He wrecked our standing in the world when foreign secretary and now is trying to finish the job - a total disgrace.
0	Johnson is a complete buffoon- a combination of bluffing/bullying and lying has got him where he is- and where we are, sinking beneath the waves.
1	Johnson is leading well. He is using reasonableness as key negotiation tool very impressively in fact. It's always a hard one for any opponent to bat back.
0/0	Johnson is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse and I hope the others ride off towards hell with him and the other Brexiters in tow, leaving the rest of us in peace.
0/1	Johnson is very much like the orange traitor in the U.S. Glad to see him stumbling.
0/0	Johnson pretends everything will be wonderful & easy with his catastrophic very extreme Brexit but eventually reality will blow up in his face,
0/0	Johnson proving once again that brexit is a concept that can't be delivered.
0/0/0	Johnson thinks he’s Churchill, but history will place him below Anthony Eden for him weakening the UK. From making up stories about the EU as a lazy journalist to the lying Leave campaign, Tory civil war and stupid election slogan, Johnson is Brexit and all that follows from it.
0/0	Johnson wants no deal. He wants to blame the EU for our post Brexit recession. He wants thick Brexiters to see change even if it’s bad. Brexit voters want to see men in peaked caps and clipboards and long queues at ports and airports. This country is rapidly going down the pan.
0/0	Johnson wants the benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‘s at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people
0/0	Johnson wants the benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‘s at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people.
0/0	Johnson warned Japanese trade deal hangs on Brussels agreement -RTing this because it matters very much for our economy, -though you'd have to have been living under a rock for it to come as actual NEWS. #StopBrexit It's a scam set up by tax avoiders.
0/0	Johnson won't be around when the shite really hits the fan. That's how it usually works in British politics.
0/0/0	Johnson's plans are quite patently NOT a realistic attempt at any compromise. Its all smoke and mirrors. He wants to crash out, because even though it will devastate the economic well being of a huge number of ordinary people, it will benefit his mega wealthy hedge fund backers!
1/1	Join us in our new found independence
1/1	Joining the EU is what fucked us in the first place. Leaving is part of the fix.
1/1/1	Jolly Good" Congratulations Great Britain. Now vote that London mayor out

0/0	Just 90 minutes for Remainers to get out & vote to save Britain as United tolerant country. #VoteRemain
1/1	Just BREXIT! Work out the details later.
1/1	Just Vote OUT ! OUT ! OUT ! on the 23rd of June. The Gov., of the BoE can always go back home if he doesn't like the idea of us being OUT of the EU !!!
0/0	Just a bunch of losers trying to keep their jobs even though it is bad for all Europeans.
1/1	Just a few hours to FREEDOM. The beginning of new 'Great' era. Let's all get behind our wonderful country! I humbly extend from Brexit hand out to all those remainers.
0/0	Just a question. how would the UK survive economically without trading with the EU. I say this because IDS says that we can control our borders and prevent immigrants fro the EU entering. That would not be possible as under a trading agreement we would be obliged to allow unrestricted access. Trading with old friends like Australia as IDS says How ? The Australian economy is intergrated with the Chinese economy that is where they are now and no way could they change their economy to accomodate us. We need Europe they need us it is as simple as that and no other trading group could even remotely take up the slack of lost trade with Europe.
0/1	Just a quick reminder that exiting EU was the easy part of this whole endeavor, and it took them 3 years to do it. Now the somehow need to negotiate the biggest, most comprehensive trade deal in the world in just 11 months.
0	Just a really bad idea presented as a good one by a bunch of power hungry liars and that is all I have to say about that.
1/1	Just a taste of how the EU will treat us if we get trapped by May's backstop with no say. Get her out get us out.
1/1	Just another chance for remainiacs to sabotage Brexit. Don’t fall for it Jacob.
0/0	Just another sorry chapter in our history. Let's hope that it will not need to be repeated yet again! Let sense and wisdom prevail, alongside a goodly dollop of humanity, love and respect for all.
0/0	Just another stupid little detail none of these Brexit geniuses has thought about.
0/0	Just another thought. The outcome of the Brexit referendum is largely based on half truths and lies ( millions to the NHS). Shouldn't that be enough to declare the outcome void and have a new one ?
1/1	Just as in America post-Trump, the Deep State crooks will fight you tooth and nail to keep their crooked Union going. They HATE people thinking for themselves as does the American Main Stream Media. They HATE Freedom. They hate The People.
1/0	Just as in the United States, the Middle Classes anger & blame due to the concentration of wealth problem was directed away from the real problem! In the case of the Brits, it was directed torward the EU! BREXIT will show the Brits that they were lied to & how beneficial EU membership really was! Re-entry to the EU will be without the preferred benefits that they threw away! Do you enjoy being played by the dishonest Conservative Media?
1/1	Just ask people who their MEP is. Because they don't know. Absolutely nobody knows. It's then a fairly simple thing to point out just how terribly they're represented by the EU...
1/1	Just ask yourselves why are we importing so many products. FFS people - we invented most of these things and used to be the country that made most of these things too....the EU has been dismantling our entire economy for forty years. .
1/-1	Just because you say that you can’t think of a good reason for Leaving, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.
0/0/0	Just call it off! You can still not exit.
0/0	Just call it off! You can still not exit. The EU says it’s ok. Tell your elected representatives to stop the whole thing. Then you could all say you were having a laugh.
0/0	Just cancel it. Brexit has failed.
1/1	Just close the borders altogether. Problem solved! We are full, our housing and public services are at breaking point. Enough is enough
0/0	Just do the vote again. I'm sure that the British are not that gullible to propagandists this time again.
1/1	Just don't betray the fishermen Boris whatever you do. We are an island nation surrounded by seas. The decimation of our fishing industry has been the greatest travesty of our membership of the EU. Fishing ports and villages reduced to historical tourist relics. Our seas are not up for discussion. Our fishermen are not bargaining chips. Don't sell them up the river.
0/0	Just don't do brexit
0/0	Just dont leave the eu. I dont See any advantage for the uk. All I hear is they want to make their own deals. What leverage do you have to demand good deals from any country once you're out of the eu? Are you planning to set sail and colonize again? I just don't get it. There will be no more future investments - rather companies will slowly move their facilities to other countries. Best of luck m8s. It'll be some tough years before you become immigrants somewhere else ;/
1/1	Just get out of the dam EUROPÉ.
1/1	Just get the hell out and do a hard BREXIT and keep the people's wealth in the UK!

1/1	Just like a Dali dreamscape, the EU is melting down, down, down...….it was all a bad dream.
0/1	Just look at all the bad losers. They still cant see the wood for trees and after all that's been said. They seem to be quite happy with another country pulling the strings to our government telling us what to do and cant do with the threat of their own army silently growing in the background .Ih what a bunch of fools .
1/1	Just love it that the Remain side seem to be getting all nasty and spiteful, we are all human after all, were is the Love????? The sun backs Brexit and they all go crazy, it's quite entertaining VOTE LEAVE but do it nicely.........not like the Remain side
1/-1	Just needs to give the impression of one, actually. They won't be interested in the details.
0/0	Just now, in a time where there is so much terror, we needed a unified European Union more than ever. I will never understand, how people can vote for actions that divides us, when we need each other more than ever.
0/0	Just reject Brexit. It was advisory not mandatory.
0/0	Just remember uk fandom, we are and always will be Children of the EU-niverse. Fuck Br*xit. #BrexitDay
1/1	Just remember when all those predictions of doom and gloom don't come true that you were being lied to and manipulated. The UK is a great and powerful nation, and it's people are hard working, tough survivors. EVERYTHING will be OK.
0/0	Just remember, when it all goes pear shaped, you can't blame the EU for not playing ball, nothing says they have to, but according to the Tories, we've got them over a barrel.
0/-1/0	Just saw an interview of a Brexiter on a TV news channel this morning. Brexiter, in stilted English, said he voted Brexit because since the 70’s when Britain joined the then EEC, the country had been in decline. Also, leaving the EU would bring in more trade deals. He doesn’t realise it was precisely that the country was in decline (Britain at this time was known as the sick man of Europe) that it sought membership of the EEC and was admitted at the third time of asking. As regards getting more trade deals, the EU already has FTA’s with over 40 countries which UK takes advantage of, and all these have to be re-negotiated, which may take years to complete. If this is typical of ignorance shown by those who voted Brexit, is it any wonder the country is in deep excrement.
0/0	Just scanning a dozen or so comments on here is showing what a nasty place the UK is becoming. I really don't know why so much hate is coming into our society and I really wish it would stop.
1/1	Just set fire to my EU flag
1/1	Just shows how spiteful remainers are. Even put the undemocratic foreign body the EU before their friendships.
0/-1	Just so long as this absurd Brexit nonsense is scrapped ASAP, I'll be happy.  Brexit was never possible without re-igniting "The Troubles" probably following border shootings related to smuggling.   Mogg and Johnson never went to Belfast when terrorism was at its height and don't understand the issues.   Cameron got bored, didn't care and decided it was better to risk splitting the country rather than the Tory party. Lets hope future prime ministers are chosen on ability not their school.
1/0	Just stay in the eu. Problem solved
0/0	Just stop brexit now...... until I sell my UK house. Then you can brexit all you like. I've done my bit for you lot, so I'd like to buy a huge bag of popcorn and watch the show !
1/1	Just subscribed! Time will show we who voted LEAVE were considering all points as to why the EU was a negative we can live without :)
1/-1	Just take read what these Remainers have to say about Leave voters. Unbelievable arrogance and elitism. It's their remarks that have caused so much devision and hate in this country. I'm looking forward to next year when we will see the economy figures.
1/1	Just tell the EU where to go with their court. What can they do throw us out good. We want that.
1/1	Just the sight of that EU flag makes me feel nauseous.
0/0	Just thick. Pointless them having a vote I'm afraid. Everyone who votes should be made to do an intelligence test.
0/0	Just think, all this chaos and uncertainty is all for absolutely nothing. The UK will be poorer and at the mercy of despots like Trump. A weakened and desperate UK will be on the losing side of any new trade deals. Losing access to the single market and customs union will really bite and people will lose their jobs when businesses who rely on frictionless trade relocate to the EU27. Brexit will end badly.
0/-1	Just to remind everyone greeting him for the speech Do not forget he is a pathetic liar
0/0	Just to remind you, only 26 percent of UK adults voted to Quit the EU. 74 percent didn't. We have now had two long years of those three Brexiteers - Davis, Boris and Fox - pretending they were working on our exit plan, but they achieved nothing, and then resigned. Goodness Brexiteers are weak people. No plan, no work, no staying power. No nothing. Just angry bitter talk and waffle.

Keep your whiskey, cars and other products in Britain. We will take care about our Prosecco, wines, flowers and other food products. Britain want to leave with BIG presents. NO WAY.

Many already have with jobs and investment lost, and this will continue as Bojo fails to get a meaningful trade deal and the UK economy takes hit after hit. A Nice and Accurate prophecy!

1/-1	Keglanek 🇬🇧 are going to be fine don’t your worry about that
0/0	Key reason for swing to Remain in latest @Survation poll is a rise to 93% in % of Remain voters who say they'd vote Remain again. At 87% equivalent Leave % little changed. Meanwhile 60% of 2016 non-voters back Remain, just 19% Leave.
1/0	Kick UK to the curb! Let them get what they deserve for their superiority complex!
1/0	Kick the Brits out, NOW
0/0	Kill Brexit

0/0	LET'S RECAP. The Deal is dead, the Government does not have the authority to execute a no deal (there is no majority) and of course, there is no clear solution in Parliament... Shouldn't we stop this madness and get on with our lives? It is clear BREXIT is IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE.

1/0	Labour and conservatives are traitors. Let’s boot those ignorant traitors out. No deal is what they should deliver.
0/-1	Labour argues that human rights and environmental rights will be worse if we leave. Conservatives argue the economy will be damaged.
0/1	Labour should learn what happened to the Lib Dems over tuition fees, which cost them a 10% dip in their vote from which they haven't recovered. For Labour, facilitating Brexit could be worse, and keep them out of power for a generation.
0/-1	Lacking negotiators,we won't have new deals any time soon or we just accept what the others offered.
1/1	Ladies & Gentlemen, and my wonderful friends & family in #TheGreatBritain NOW, this FINALLY means something!
0/0	Last call: Let's not abandon ship - just when we're making headway
0/0	Last night was an embarrassment. The Brady amendment is meaningless. The Eu has negotiated in good faith and it was uk who proposed the backstop and way in which it is worded. Time to try and when back respect and prosperous future. She should revoke article 50. No sane person can say continuing with Brexit makes any sense.
0/1	Last time I checked, Great Britain is still in Europe. They only left a phoney "post-national" organization
1/0	Late 2018 and I am still hoping for a revote !
0/0	Late to the party, but I might as well comment. I think that both campaigns have been a joke, media reporting of campaigns has been a joke, the fact we're having the referendum in the first place is a joke, and that if we leave we will just be poorer but nothing will really change. For the record I'm a firm remainer, and I would vote to remain even if there was evidence that we would be better off out, because i believe in a united europe. I had an ERASMUS year, most of my friends are europeans living all over the continent, I travel regularly around europe and i intend to work in europe in the future if i get the opportunity. The only thing thhat really separates the people of europe is language. We all have similar cultures and similar values, and i can't understand this 'us and them' situation that has arisen over the past 10 years. The media have been shown to be very much supporting brexit, whilst pretending to be impartial to an extent. This is no surprise considering that Rupert Murdoch has previously said he wants out of the EU as it will give him more influence in government. What strikes me most about media coverage is that there has been no effort to explain the PROPORTIONALITY of anything this campaign. - When THIRTEEN nobel prize winners said we should remain, the same amount of coverage was given to the ONE who said we should leave. - When a COMPANY (i.e. the board) in Rolls Royce say we should remain as it would benefit their employees etc, the same coverage is given to an individual in the owner of JCB saying we should leave as it would benefit him. - When the misleading figure of '£350m a day' is banded about constantly, there is no mention that this equates to just 0.5% of GDP. The leave campaign has repeatedly talked about europe being run 'for the elites', and everyone just seems to believe it, but if you look at the prominent brexit supporters and campaign funders, they are all extremely wealthy people with vested interests in leaving. they are quite literally the elites trying to deceive britons for their own personal gain. Shall we look at the people fronting the brexit campaign whilst we're at it, and see how they are trying to help the people of britain? - Michael Gove - Incompetent ex-education secretary, whose ideas whilst in office were so offensive to the teaching profession that he caused them to strike several times before losing his job. Doing equally well as justice secretary. He wants to leave because his dad lost his fishing job when we joined the EU. - Boris Johnson - Holds extremely right wing views, and whilst appearing to be a bumbling loveable buffoon, is actually extremely intelligent and dangerous. During his time as london mayor he accomplished nothing except to make london less accessible to poorer people, and ignore legislation in order to benefit wealthy property developers. He wants to leave in the hope that David cameron is forced to resign so he can become prime minister. - Nigel Farage - A man who openly encourages fear of foreigners (see UKIP's latest poster) and repeatedly misleads the public. During his time in brussels his party has actively voted against laws that would directly benefit the people of this country, or just not voted at all.... and he talks about democracy. The only reason we're having this referendum is because Cameron was scared he might lose supporters to UKIP in the general election. They narrowly won a majority with 30% of the vote (democracy again eh). He is quite frankly a fucking idiot who has created a split in the people of this country for no reason. At the end of the day, every negative the leave campaign give about the eu, or that people think will be improved by leaving the EU, has been caused by government policy rather than 'immigrants', 'unelected bureaucrats' (they are elected) or any of the other bullshit excuses being trotted out. Austerity has harmed the population of this country far more than the EU ever has. There's plenty more i can say, but i think that will do for now. haven't even mentioned the actual content of the campaigns
1/-1	Laughable for little Tom Pr!ck to describe Buik as naive - he is an experienced and well respected City broker and commentator who was just stating the bleedin obvious. The numerous comments below expose the self loathing EU lackeys who cheer on the EU at every occasion rather than supporting their own country, and constantly seek to undermine the UKs negotiating position. The Remoan MPs are obvioulsly worse in this respect. If the like of scum like Grieve, Sourbry, Wollaston and a lot of Labour MPs (mincer Bradshawe as an example) had expended their energy in achieving Brexit rather than fighting it every inch of the way, it would have been done and dusted long ago, with much better deal. The EU have sought to use our divisions and internal bickering to strengthen their position , which is of course the aim of the quisling remoaners.
1/1	Lax border controls in other EU countries already make it easier for illegal migrants and terrorists to get into Britain, despite the UK staying outside Schengen.
1/1	Lead Brexit, follow those leading Brexit, or get out of Britain. Be part of the solution to put the “great” back into Britain or get out of Britain.
1/1/1	Leave 1) I have three governments currently. The EU / EC / EP / CoE , Westminister and Holyrood (Scottish Parliament). Why on earth do I need to have three lots of bureaucrats making a nice salary where one parliament works for most countries outside the EU. 2) Despite being a member of the EEA and Union. Britain has consistently been outvoted or vetoed when we try to put forward legislation to benefit us. Even trying to get trade deals in place means we have to have the blessing of all member states in the EU. Meaning deals and negotiations takes years upon years. 3) The uncontrolled immigration of unskilled EU migrants combined with the lack of will power from both Labour and Conservative governments have resulted in British working class being shafted by wage compression, competition for jobs and community services. 4) Finally the more nuanced one, many remainers I see in London are part of the decadent, bourgeoisie class who enjoy their tofu, halloumi and avocado wraps with their nice expensive coffees. When asked why they want to remain, they mention their desire for a pan-globalist utopia where everyone gets on with each other in a European Union where they can go for a jolly to another country. Whoever doesn't subscribe to their worldview is considered a pleb or racist "little Englander". Well, fuck those people in their rose tinted bubbles. They have never worked a hard day in their life or grew up on an estate where the working class of Britain have been forgotten and left to pick up the pieces from uncontrolled immigration. Also one last thing from Chairman Corbyn, who today said their can be no control on immigration inside the EU: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36570383
1/1	Leave Britons, leave! Take back your sovereignty!
1/1/1	Leave EU and mother Merkel in jail
1/1	Leave EU please, and united all british people for out of un democraty EU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brexit means brexit
1/1	Leave I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for the "United States of Europe" concept, which isn't what most of the people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union', but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be looking out for its own interests before ours. I believe this is the last chance we'll have to get out. We'll always have the ability to call another referendum, but if we remain within the EU on Thursday you can be sure that the EU will make sure we're never in a position to consider leaving again. They're already spending billions of euros sending propaganda to school kids to tell them how great the EU is. I believe that power should be closer to people, not sent to a different country. There's nothing to stop countries working together to achieve great things in this world - but that doesn't require the removal or dilution of nation states. The USA wouldn't allow Argentina, Mexico and Brazil to write over 50% of its laws and accept free movement from those countries. Immigration doesn't affect me much, but it does have an affect on many towns in the UK. It pushes down wages at the lower end of the pay-scale and it puts pressure on public services. I'm all for immigration, but the speed that it's changed is not good - it's pushing people to the right or far right. In some towns Brits have become a minority within the space of a decade or two, so it's understandable that it's made some people feel uneasy. I think an economy that relies on mass immigration is unsustainable in the long term. The money that the EU 'spends' on us is a silly argument, because that's tax payers money to begin with. Europe is failing. Politics within Europe is changing fast, the eurozone is unstable, unemployment is high and the migration crisis was handled poorly. I don't think we'll be the only country calling a referendum in the next few years. Finally, I don't just don't think the EU is reformable. David Cameron tried to get reforms, and EVEN THOUGH he had such a strong card to play (a potential exit), he came away with basically nothing. If he can't get any reforms when he's got the threat of the UK leaving, he'll never get any reforms. I think an exit from the EU will cause some economic disruption. Some businesses will suffer, others will flourish. I think it's worth it, though. The whole "I don't want to be on the same side as Farage, Boris..etc.." thing is just nonsense. I don't care who is on either side and there's some fantastic voices on both.
0/0	Leave and live with the consequences. British politics have gone from the relatively sublime to the ridiculous and now into the realm of pure farce.
1/1/0	Leave are trying to hide the shit storm their Brexit vanity project is going to rain down on us.
1/1	Leave because sovereignty is important. The Euro is poisoning the whole of the EU. Better to get out now than wait until the inevitable disorderly break up. Open borders is not a good idea either, particularly with countries much poorer than yourself and who are locked in an austerity death spiral.
0/0/0	Leave dismissed warnings from economists and international bodies about the economic impact of Brexit as "scaremongering" by a self-serving elite.

1/1/1/1	Leave. I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
1/1	Leave. I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
1/1/-1	Leave. I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with fewer executions.

1/1	Leave. It'll be hard for a year or two making adjustment and negotiating trade deals countries all over the world including the EU, but in the end Britian will have more control (in terms of immigration and trade) in the direction they want to go.
1/1/1	Leave. The question I ask myself is this: do I want to live in an independent, self-governing country where the people are in control of shaping their own destiny, or do I want us to remain in a corrupt, anti-democratic, Soviet Union in the making? Former Statesman, Mikhail Gorbachev has come out and said that "the EU is the new Soviet Union dressed in western clothes" and I agree with him.   Contrary to what many say, the EU is not wholly about creating jobs/opportunities and trade for people, it's mostly about power and the formation of a superstate. A superstate, which like the Soviet Union, is doomed to fail. Additionally, instead of keeping Europe peaceful as is so often claimed, the EU is likely to be the cause of the next major conflict in Europe. Because when you continue to strip people of their democracy and overrule them when making choices which affect themselves and future generations, you piss a lot of people off, and you don't need to be a student of history to know that eventually it will lead to tension, conflict and even war.

0/0	Leaving Europe will be a catastrophe for this country, economically and politically, but most important of all culturally. It would be depressing to live in an inward looking anti-diverse country.
0/1/1	Leaving Europe will not mean that we are free of the rules set in Brussels; not if we wish to continue to enjoy the advantages of trading with Europe anyway. We will simply no longer have any influence over the rules that Europe sets for us.
0/0	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy
0/0	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy.
1/1	Leaving aside that the anti-Brexit Observer View now anoints itself to represent what Brexit voters intended, it is most revealing that the same column that claims for itself "the universal vision of progressive societies" at the same time endorses importing foreigners for slave-labor pay and conditions, rather than agitate that if the jobs are "badly paid", then it is not the "British-born worker" who is at fault but the fault of those who refuse to pay a living wage -- and their enablers.
0/0	Leaving needs to be stopped altogether.
1/1	Leaving on 29/3 with "No Deal" continues to be by far and away the most popular petition on the HoC. Leavers, keep supporting / sharing the petition to nail the lie that "No Deal" is unsupported.
0/0	Leaving the EU in the manner we seem about to still seems foolish to me.
0/0	Leaving the EU is a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain’s prosperity & Europe’s stability.
1/1	Leaving the EU is a victory for British,
0/0	Leaving the EU is an empty promise. It’s easy to persuade people with nothing to lose that everything will be better outside of the Union. This is what Boris and Cummings have realised. They have no plan for the future apart from selling nostalgia and right wing old fashioned nationalism. More than half of the U.K. population know that the country will be worse off in every respect, not only economically, and that those with the least will be hit disproportionately hard. For shame Daniel Hannan, for shame. #FBPE #stilleuropean
1/1	Leaving the EU is by far the best thing possible.
0/0	Leaving the EU is financial suicide for Britain. Yes, they will have their pride intact and that is all they will have Another Ukraine on the horizon. Ireland and Scotland need to leave Britain and not allow itself to be used by The Bank of England and they're in ongoing Ponzi scheme. The EU is the only thing keeping the Bank of England from totally finishing off the working class.
0/0	Leaving the EU is like dropping out of school, its lazy&may seem best but staying&working to overcome any problems is far better
1/1	Leaving the EU is our only opportunity to rebuild our broken political scene, and free up the many good aspects of British business outside the restrictive, stagnating and non-aspirational EU market, and I do not mean by abandoning all principles of safety and decency.
1/1	Leaving the EU is the ONLY way for Britain to survive as a country.

0/-1	Leaving the EU now being a given, Johnson is right to seek a radical break. It's a bet that the thing up ahead isn't an iceberg, just a wall of fog you can drive through.
1/1	Leaving the EU on WTO rules is not "crashing out". It's keeping £39bn of our money, and having the freedom to do Free Trade Deals around the world.
1/1	Leaving the EU on WTO terms on 29th March 2019 is essential for the UK.
1	Leaving the EU on my birthday what a day 2 remember

1/1/1/1	Leaving the EU will hopefully put the Great back into Britain. Give Britain back to the British.
0/0	Leaving the EU will increase immigration to UK by 5 million.
0/0	Leaving the EU will not solve any of your problems. The only thing that will definitely change is that you won't be able to blame the EU for everything which goes wrong in your daily life. You will experience how 450 million Europeans feel about the British behaviour when going on your next holiday to Spain, Italy or Greece. Enjoy your splendid isolation while we await Scotland to rejoin the EU in the near future.
0/0	Leaving the EU will undoubtedly leave the UK worse off and will affect the poorest the hardest.
0/0/0	Leaving the EU would actually cause economic problems for theEU an UK, but the UK's problems would last longer and be worse
0/0	Leaving the EU would be a massive leap into uncertainty. The UK and other disaffected members have to make it work. We are not the United states of Europe, we have to stop those who are trying to turn us into one.
0/0	Leaving the EU would hurt Britain—and would also deal a terrible blow to the West
0/0	Leaving the EU would mean never get our stolen money back.
0/1	Leaving the European Union is not about stopping immigration its about controlling it. Mass immigration is harmful to society and only benefit the rich. Its also about Democracy we need to leave or its the end of freedom. This is a battle between the poor vs the rich and I am on the side of the poor.
0/1	Leaving the European Union was a big mistake. You will all regret it in a few years
0/1	Leaving was a decision after hangover, and just overturn it
1/1	Leaving will also allow us to free up our net contribution to the EU — a staggering £250million a week — ­to spend wherever it is most needed.

1/1	Leftist TLDR are super pissed that all there amendments failed in the commons, NO second Referendum, No extension to Article 50, hahahah we are LEAVING. Best tell George Soros that
1/1	Leftists be like: "Nooooooo! Why? How dare the UK choose sovereignty instead of leftist servitude??? They must be punished! Let's wish them bad luck!"
1/1	Leftists would rather be ruled by unelected oligarchs and being invaded by millions of immigrants who their country don't need,than being called racists or have their independence.

1/1/1/1/1	Let March 29th be celebrated annually as Brexit Day in Britain from this March onward to mark the momentous day that Britain became Independent once more!
0/0/0	Let chaos reign. Scotland and Northern Ireland don't want to play your big ego games. You despise the EU so much, and because of it, all the UK will have to pay for it. The EU should just give you no deal, no bail out. You and Nigel deserve every bit of pain. The people don't.
0/0	Let everyone come!! Let us all move around and go where we want and stay in an organisation where we can go and work in Spain if we want, or Germany or France, and live among a diversity of cultures.
1/1	Let freedom reign!
0	Let me be clear. Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and our national security.
0/0	Let me put it this way: If somebody says ‘I want to leave your house, but I’ll take the key and I will come back whenever I like and take whatever I like from that house.”, that doesn’t work,” Seems clear to me, but that’s what UK wants and EU says no go!
0/0	Let the Breshiteers do the jobs, the EU citizens know very well that they have another 27 European countries were they can move without suffering abuse from the population, media or the Home office. No one wants to move to a country were speaking your language can be the cause of their death.
1/1/1	Let the British people elect a UKIP government if they want Brexit to happen.

0/0	Let the people decide if they want to go on with this madness.
1/1	Let them have their swansong then slap them down, exit the EU and then clear out the political sewer that is Westminster. That is what they really fear. They want to hold on to the EU teat and keep their indiscretions a secret. The expenses scandal is just the tip of the iceberg.

0/-1	Let us never forget this. They are utter liars.
0/0	Let us see how it is in the end. Uk will not have a plus in the end.
1/1	Let's ALL take back our sovereignty from the global Central Banking Mafia!
0/1	Let's also bust another Brexiteer myth. There has been limited visible negative economic impact so far "post referendum" for two reasons. 1. We haven't left yet...only when we have will the economy get hit. 2. The pound devalued from around 1.3 to 1.1 which boosted UK competitiveness.
1/1	Let's be brave and leave without a deal, things have a way of working out. Fed up of the EU calling the shots we should be in the driving seat. At least this expert is saying it's not a doom and gloom scenario if we have no deal!
0/1	Let's be honest for a change.We want our country back is what they really mean a white English speaking soceity.
0/0/0	Let's be honest here... England is sinking like the Titanic.
1/1	Let's be honest. The UK is not worried if we get a deal with the EU, but, the EU are. UK will be getting trade deals world-wide.
0/0	Let's cancel it instead please. It's not working, and it's very expensive.
0/-1	Let's face it, #BorisJohnson says one thing one day, something else the next day and something else the third day. His only consistency is that he LIES all the bl**dy time!
0/0	Let's face it, the UK is no longer the imperialist powerhouse it use to be, and imperialism is not going to come back into fashion anytime soon. Nor do I think UK would be able to, with American military might. SO now you have a country that has no gunboat diplomacy left
0	Let's face it, we have a PM who is either grossly incompetent or just doesn't give a toss about the damage he's inflicting on our country. I suspect it's both!
0/-1	Let's get #LiarJohnson removed, #article50 cancelled and Corbyn installed to do all those properly
1/1	Let's get behind it and be positive about the future, otherwise feel free to leave!

1/1	Let's get on with it.
1/1	Let's get out on WTO terms and come back in ten years and ask the people if they wish to rejoin the undemocratic and corrupt cesspool that is the EU.
1/1	Let's get out under WTO. I didn't vote for a f------g deal, nor did I vote for meetings to satisfy the side that lost ie. the Remainers. We're now heading for a soft Brexit which will be just the same as not leaving. What the f--k is happening! The remainers in the Government and the country have caused this whole fiasco. If we had left under WTO rules 2 years ago we would have been over the initial economic disruption and pain by now (which a lot of us Leavers accepted would happen) and on our way to a bright independent future, while the EU would continue it's inevitable decline. F--k.
1/1	Let's hear the British Lion roar on Thursday ! Take back control of our destiny and VOTE LEAVE!!
1/1	Let's hope Brexit heralds a new era of prosperity for this nation! One thing is for certain the remoaners won't admit it even if it is!
1/1/1	Let's hope it's the beginning of the end of the Imperialist EU. 🇬🇧
1/1	Let's hope so. It's time the centre left got over its unthinking sentimental attachment to the undemocratic last century relic that is the EU.
0/0	Let's hope the EU say no then they will know the brunt thearesa may has had!!
1/1	Let's just get out ..no matter what!
0/0	Let's just hope that the hysterical screaming brexiloons who want to rip us out of the EU without any sort of arrangement despite apparently not understanding how either the EU or the UK works will accept the blame if it all goes wrong...
0	Let's just hope the UK can recover from shooting itself in the head, and Boris and his bigots don't destroy this country. They've already seriously damaged our democracy, the economy, our reputation and the integrity of the Union.

0/0	Let's support Remain option, Europe is the only way to afford the future. Alone we lose!
0	Let's take back control of our laws." So far: Vote Leave: broke the law, LeaveEU: broke the law, BeLeave: broke the law, Facebook: broke the law, Constitutional Research Council: broke the law Today. Eldon: broke the law #antibrexit
1/1	Let's take back control!
1/-1	Let's think about creative solutions. Said no remainer ever.
1/1	Lets be honest, how many people think the EU shouldnt be replaced with something new, a sensible Europe, fit for the 21st century. The EU is a dinosaur designed from the remnants of an age of blocs and Empires. The futures is independence, local decision making, devolution. In the internet age, its easy for people from other countries to communicate and work together, we dont need bureaucracy to do it.

1/1	Lets leave this lot are screwing us into the ground, they have held us to ransom and we don't need them but they need our money to hold up the other countries that don't contribute any monies but take as much as they can get, so lets get out
1/1	Lets make our great Britain SUPERIOR AGAIN 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻
0/0	Lets not forget why the EU was formed in the first place, amongst all the anti-muslim racism, the EU was formed at the behest of Winston Churchill to prevent another World War, and up until now it has worked.....
1/1	Lets stop the moaning and get behind the most exciting change the UK has seen in decades!
1/1	Letting in millions of culturally incompatible migrants has shafted the young. Brexit is the solution.
0/0	Letts stop being a biased idiot, ONLY one-third of 'The People' voted to leave the EU (a minority) Theresa May is rightly trying to satisfy the TWO-thirds who did NOT express any such will to leave.....Tell us how YOU would go about doing that Quentin or would you simply ignore the Plebs???????
1/1	Let’s all take a moment to remember Dominic Cummings as one of the masterminds behind the victorious Brexit campaign and for his efforts in securing the vote.
0/0	Let’s be clear: enabling Brexit means allowing a hit to economy which we know occurs in ALL Brexit scenarios.
1/1	Let’s do a Trump ! And build a wall !
1/-1/1	Let’s get Brexit done fab slogan.. bit like every little helps! The elite of the UK don’t want the EU changes to tax havens to affect the UK’s 1% pocket books! Boris is the puppet for the real powers at be
1/0	Let’s get one thing clear, personally I in no way believe that all those who voted for Brexit are racist or stupid. People voted based on the information (albeit limited and misleading) put before them by politicians. We could just as easily have arrived at a result by counting belly buttons. Innies Vs Outies. Turns out we are a nation of outies.
0/0	Let’s hope we are not sleep walking towards an exit from the EU
1/1	Let’s leave the EU! The media just makes up the Brexiteers mind. Not going to work media

0/0	Liars shall not prosper. The weaker, more fragile union will disintegrate. The weaker union is the UK.
1/0	Lies, lies, lies, Telegraph. Overloaded with Remainers?? What utter nonsense.
1/1	Life and business would go on outside the EU. No point living if fear and clinging to the EU come what may. Let's give it a go.
0/0	Life has been too good on this planet. People need some awfulness in their lives, otherwise they get bored. Lets bring back first 50 years of 20th century for the fun of it!
0/0	Life in the UK is pretty shit now, low wages few opportunities. The EU does provide jobs. So leaving the EU will make a bad situation worse. Seems like you're trying to make that line of reasoning sound ridiculous... when it's completely reasonable.
0/0	Life is worse with brexit now if www3 atually happens and if someone attacks us whos gonna back us
0/0	Like America's last presidential election, the only way the wrong right can win, is dishonestly.
1/1	Like every once in a while I try to understand the whole system, how they talk about "soft brexit" and "partial quasi low-calory brexit" or what have you, but I just don't get their political system at all. But I can read subtext, and what I can tell is that the politicians in Bongistan are doing absolutely whatever they can to make the deal be "no brexit" despite the fact that what their people CLEARLY voted for was, fucking "BREXIT."
1/1	Like him or not, this was a very good speech by Farage.
0/0	Like many of my peers, I’m strongly opposed to the idea of the UK leaving the EU. I think the reasoning behind this is that many (younger) Remainers just don’t see the point in destroying a relationship which has not only been fairly stable, but also incredibly beneficial to the UK and its inhabitants, particularly when we youths haven’t known an alternative all our lives.
0/0/0	Like many others In the thread I'm Welsh and plan on staying in Wales through university. My area particularly has had massive funding from the EU so I'll be voting Remain. While I don't think that the statistics can be trusted from either side the Leave campaign has been painful. Just the fact that Boris Johnson is the figurehead for Brexit is a massive turn away. Not to mention that the Tories would be given further political power without EU restrictions. So yeah, I'll be voting Remain.
0/0/0	Like the Conservatives, Labour has yet to spell out how it will manage migration after Brexit, and has not been drawn on the size of "divorce bill" it would be willing to pay.
0/0	Likewise - a complete nightmare - when will everyone wake up and realise we should STAY
1/-1	Likewise the pound is doing its normal ups and downs - still well above the last low back in Dec 2008
0/0	Listen to people in industry who know what they’re talking about ffs. Great Britain going out of Europe with no viable trading mechanisms is a very very bad thing. This puerile ‘leave means leave’ mantra is just brainless rhetoric, blindly sending our country back in time 70 years to satisfy the will of a bunch of badly informed voters is utter madness.
0/0	Listen. The immigrant children that live in this country would have their dreams and future fulfilments crushed if the country leaves the EU. I'm a 16 year old boy that feels the same way. I don't want to leave this country. This is my only hope of becoming a doctor in the future. In Lithuania I stand no chance, as the economy is poorly and funding into education is quite limiting too. I really want to stay in this country. I would lose so many friends if we left, as well as leaving my education behind. Do yourself a favour and stop being such racists and ignoring the range of advantages of staying in the EU. I promise you there will be more of them than if you would vote leave. Thank you.
0/-1	Literally no one in Scotland voted for Brexit...
0/0	Literally the thing that people voted Brexit for, is something the EU already does.
0/0	Little Britain sees a further class divide as the poorer become poorer and the rich carry on.
0/0	Living in Northern Ireland, I am concerned the effects a leave vote has on political stability here with votes having been cast upon traditional party lines – green and orange politics prevailing. The DUP supported Brexit while Sinn Féin were for remain. The latter have already called for a poll on Northern Ireland’s status within the UK, which will only serve to further complicate relations between Unionists and Nationalists. Nevertheless, what happens with the north/south border is a valid concern as bureaucratic measures will affect free movement and trade. We in Northern Ireland are, under the Good Friday Agreement, entitled to Irish citizenship and by extension, EU citizenship, but whether this claim to citizenship will now be dependent upon acquisition of an Irish passport is yet to be seen. My main concern is what impact the leave verdict has upon jobs with so much employment, especially in the charity sector, dependent upon EU funding. Leave creates job uncertainty and is a huge snub to the immigrants living, studying, and working here. I cannot envision how Brexit is going to bring working-class unity. Instead, I imagine that it will result in reactionary policies that are only going to bring more social segregation and economic deprivation.

1/1	Lol Jk Rowlings yeah right she worried about her money! People r been foolish was best choice to leave as time will tell
1/-1	Lol everyone is attacking anyone opposed like it's the easiest decision in the world. Facts are probably wrong but I heard it was 52/48 split vote. Obviously there was no "huge majority", this was a difficult choice, and people on both sides have great pros and cons to their reasons. So instead, major kudos to EVERYONE that voted, no matter the side. Utilizing something other countries rarely get a chance to do.

0/0	Lol. More claptrap and balderdash from Hannan. The EU has been consistent for months on the backstop. Totally consistent. The UK govt agreed the deal. All 27 EU nations agreed the deal.

1/1/0	Look at all these young people saying it was a terrible idea with the little real world experience that they have. It just shows how synthesized these people were into believing that being in the EU was a good thing. Politicians should be charged by corrupting the youth. The plan all along was to create one super state and keep certain people in power inside EU like as if they were kings. Nobody even votes and they appoint themselves in power. These "old people" that you punks like to bash just saved your asses. Respect your elders as they have more wisdom in their hand than you do in your entire body you little shits . If you love undemocratic rules how about you go live in an Arab country.
1/1	Look at the Rrreeeee from some of these tools who think freedom is bad, how being happy to have your independence is bad because something... these idiots think the EU is everything yet they know nothing about it, they think the EU gives them anything outside of taking your money and restricting what you can do and what your country can do.

If the Italian army needs more Land Rovers or RR engines they phone Solihull or RR. Why do we need massive luxurious buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg staffed by spoilt pampered bastards on huge salaries and perks for doing bugger all. If at the next full sitting of the EU parliament a meteor came to earth and wiped out the lot of them, Europe wouldn't come to and end, nobody would notice no difference.Shower of tossers, they sit there and applaud each other for their wonderfulness, insulated and detached from reality.
1/0	Looking at the wonderful cross section of cultures, ages and skin colours in Parliament Square HAHAHAHAHA ONLY KIDDING IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION IN A WHITE FOOL FACTORY #BrexitDay #BrexitCelebration
0/0	Looking at these comments that are glad that the UK left is...laughable
0/0	Looking forward to all the thick racists who voted for Brexit working for a shilling a day until they're too old, after which they can beg in the streets.
1/0	Looking forward to the 60% council tax cut and 350 million a week because of Brexit
1/1	Looking forward to the collapse of the Soviet Unio- I mean, European Union.
0/-1	Looking forward to welcoming an independent and social democratic Scotland to the EU. And while I feel for the middle and working classes in the rest of Britain, ever more at the mercy of the rapacious privateers, I expect that the punishment meted out by the EU will serve as a deterrent to further secessionist folly, strengthening the union and weaking right populism.
1/1/1	Looks like Boris got Brexit done to me... perhaps all those people decrying his promises on the hustings should come in the comments section here and admit they didn’t have a clue.
0/0	Looks like Boris was so determined to blow Brexit that he doesn't have a clue as to what happens next. You did it now lets see what you got?
1/1	Looks like British will have an Independence Day of their own,. Congratulations!!!
0/1	Looks like No-Deal Brexit is on its way. EU's Barnier will NOT renegotiate the Irish backstop. A total failure by PM May, her cabinet and the House of Commons.
1/1	Looks like UK and USA are both winning Nigel! Congratulations to you on full Brexit!
1/0	Looks like a 4 year old has been left to play with his mum's phone again
0/0	Looks like a pain sandwich
0/0	Looks like the UK is headed for the bin, at full throttle.
0/0	Looks like the UK's future lies in WTO terms then, good luck. I doubt that by then there will be a single car plant left in the UK. Watch out for massive unemployment, particularly in the north where they showed such confidence in the greatest con artist in the world.
1/1	Looks like they want far more from us than we do from them ie we have the upper hand.
0/0	Looks like voting to leave the EU was a pretty fucking stupid idea, huh?
1/1	Looks lime the British have two holidays now in January. New Year eve and independence day.
1/1	Lord Adonis - arch evil! "People's Vote?". Was he asleep? We have already HAD one !
1/1	Lose our say in the EU, gain our say in WTO and a dozen other organisations where far more of world trade rules are decided.
0/0	Lose-lose for Europe and UK both
1/1	Lost Europe? EU is not europe, Britain has strong possition in europe and can make their own trade deals, even without EU and it´s stupid regulations of free trade, honestly EU breng NOTHING good to Europe
0/0	Lost it at 'dictatorial United States of Europe'. Who believes this shameless spreaing of lies?
0/0	Lost opportunities Lost education Lost investment lost jobs lost health lost security, #Stopbrexit
1/0/-1	Lot of moaners in the comments but the thumbs up are 2 to 1 compared to the downs; about the same ratio as the Great British Public's choice.
1/1	Lot of remainers taking the stand again,on these comments page you can never ever get it into your thick skulls that the EU is already crumbling,and this country is the first,followed by Italy,France,and the rest will be history.
1/0	Lots of Brexit supporters are still complaining, about the EU, 'remoaners' and everything else
0/0	Lots of Brexit supporters are still complaining, about the EU, 'remoaners' and everything else.
0/0	Lots of Leavers believe that #Brexit will be "short-term pain for long-term gain". That TRILLION DOLLARS in assets that HAVE ALREADY LEFT the UK ain't coming back. Those companies ain't coming back. That FDI ain't coming back. It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
1/1	Lots of anti-Brexit trolls out this morning dedicated to preventing sensible pro-Brexit debate. I don’t know who they’re aiming their drivel at. Their narratives (a polite term for lies) have no traction with anyone with half a brain.
1/1/1	Lots of countries doing good that are not in the EU. Look at Norway and Switzerland.
0/0	Lots of deluded Leavers thinking we are in control The simple fact is they can do more damage to UK than we can do to EU Exporting services requires alignment
0/0	Lots of great laws would never have happened if they weren't introduced at EU level.
1/1/1	Lots of negative remoaners around this morning. Stay positive, don’t rise to their bait. Brexit!!! , we’ve done it!
1/1	Lots of rhetoric, however, a few facts are in order. Since joining the UK has paid in £507 billions (current value) we pay £12 billions per annum, we pay in VAT and we pay in CET. It's a racket, Ireland is richer than the UK and just takes out. The UK, after the USA is the only significant military power helping to ensure the EU's security for which we get nothing in return. Indeed if Germany paid its way it would cost them an extra €30 billions per year in military spending. So enough nonesense from the Remoaners trying to say that the EU is great it's a mess just take a look at its unemployment rates.
1/1	Love Brexit, just love it :) And this is only beginning ;)
1/1	Love Europe Hate the EU

1/1	Love cooperation and trade. Hate being ruled by an unelected elite. Out.
0/-1	Love him or hate him he was a leader and that’s what we lack now. The wrong PM and without an opposition and we are in the biggest crisis since WW2. Even May knows this road we take is disastrous but on we go to tumble over the cliff edge.
1/0	Love how nationalist in USA are praising the UK for the Brexit.
1/1	Love our country now this has happened
0	Love the fact they played recorded bells in Parliament Square tonight. Even their victory chimes are ersatz. Plastic playboy patriots. #BrexitDay
1/1	Love the feeling of deciding our own future again. Its a great day...to all Brexiteers have a great evening. To all remainers...well let's hope it works out better than you think. You never know unless you try. Onward fellow Brits.

0/-1	Love watching American commentators on Brexit they’re often very misinformed or misinterpret information.
1/1	Loved being called a xenophobe and a nationalist all in one sentence. Social scientist of the ELITE, definitely.
0/-1	Loved the interviews where people couldn't explain what we are able to do now we have left EU
0/-1/0	Loved the interviews where people couldn't explain what we are able to do now we have left EU. They kept going on about "We have our freedom back" etc. when everyone's daily lives are going to be the same. I don't think anyone felt opressed by the EU until the idea of Brexit was pushed on everyone. It's all so silly. I don't think anyone cared much about the UK's relationship with the EU until it was questioned at the start of all this.
0/1	Lovely lot, Brexiters. And if you're not a hateful bigot, shame you chose to side with hateful bigots. And, some might say, telling.
0/1	Loving the Brexiteer extreme rhetoric about how the EU owe the UK for past events. Ever thought the rest of the world (or at least the old "Empire") may be thinking the same thing when it comes to future trade agreements with the U.K. for the hundreds of years of pillaging and occupation? Be careful what you wish for and the tone you adopt when dealing with others

0/1	MONEY MONEY MONEY..... they are IGNORING the real reasons the MAJORITY want , and voted to get OUT OUT OUT!
1/1	MPs need to know voters who voted to leave would still vote leave There's been no change in how people feel about the EU and how it effects them. British jobs for the British tax and Stamp payer.
1/1	Ma Corgis are Ready 4 Brexit!
0/0	Macron and Co are risking recession in Europe just to teach Brexit Britain a lesson
1/-1	Macron's country erupts into mass violence every weekend. Who's he to go criticising? Lol
1	Main Stream Media is cancer! And this headline "How Britain lost Europe" is deliberately confusing to people. The UK voted to LEAVE....we voted....understand?
1/1	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states.
1/1	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states. The idea of federalisation is a leading light in the EU and it's a lot easier to put the boot down on a whole continent if you're governing the whole continent.

1/1	Makes ME all kinds of proud and I live in Alabama! I love seeing decent, good folk prosper!
0/0/0	Makes me feel physically ill. To think that this is what our once great nation has become.
1/1	Makes me sick those who think Britain will struggle to survive without the corrupt EU.
1/-1	Makes not one ounce of difference, people's opinions and reasons are excuses for their own decisions.
1/1	Makes you wonder how the 92.2% of people worldwide not in the EU survive
0/0	Making it more difficult and costly to trade is something that helps UK citizens/companies in general?
0/0/0	Making two million people unemployed overnight is more likely to lead to social unrest.
1/-1	Malign forces full stop. The same ones behind the destruction of our beautiful planet and all her stupendously fine
0/0	Man, I still don't understand this. But it sounds like no one really knows what will happen. Why don't they just draw on a big white board what is good about the EU and what is bad about being in the EU and start passing some laws to remove the bad pieces. Like if they don't like the free movement of goods and people from country to country put in a road block where you vet each immigrant. This law is like a local ordinance that supersedes how the EU does business. For example I live in a town in the US where it is illegal to sell alcohol or operate a bar. The town just doesn't want it. So when we want to go to a bar we drive over to Chicago 10 minutes away. At the end of the day don't worry about British company stocks soaring way down and Euro in a free fall down. These are actually good things and they are happening merely because of stock traders (legalized gambling) want to push it down. So why is it good: 1) Because the company is still a good company and now when you save you can buy more shares. You don't look at what it's doing you just save every month. And 2) the Euro going down means you are crazy competitive with the US, China, Japan, and every other non EU market. Every country wants to devalue it's currency. There is a gentlemen's agreement that no country will do this on purpose. But Japan and China are masters of it. And you guys go a huge devalue and you didn't do it on purpose. Finally don't believe the BS that you can never go back. Of course they will take you back, they never wanted to lose you. Just don't panic. Do what you do best everyday and it will be all good!
1/0	Man, all these clueless and ignorant people commenting about leaving the EU 😅 Leaving the EU is a very good thing. I just wish my country would do the same. Well, technically we're not in the EU, but we still have some arrangement with the EU.
0/0/0	Many Brexiters are so thick they were unable to understand how it might affect the company they worked for. "We don’t mind being a bit poorer if we get our sovereignty back" - they didn’t translate that as "you might lose your job".
1/0	Many Brexiters couldn't understand only words. I read them writing things like "we've have always been a great country, an Empire". Yes, but you can't eat the Queen's crown .. It's all sooo incredible.
0/-1	Many Britons — whether they wanted to leave the EU or remain — were so exasperated by the interminable wrangling that they voted in last month’s election for the politician who promised to get it all over with: Johnson
1/1	Many Dutch people envy the Uk right now.
1/0	Many EU countries oppose Islamification of their countries
0/0	Many Leavers have not yet twigged that it will be several months before Brexshit hits the fan.
0/0	Many Remainers accept the advice in this article and easily see the opportunities afforded to the UK by leaving the EU. But we also know that the UK is not prepared to exploit these; and that is why we voted to remain. It is not from a woolly-minded vision of EUtopia that we voted, but a hard-headed assessment of how the UK’s weak educational system, protectionist instincts, and low-calibre leadership make it unfit to challenge the world alone. And that is without mentioning the issues we face on Scottish and NI independence, with Wales and English regions to follow. We are not flag wavers, but hard-headed pragmatists.
0/0	Many UK workers will become second-class workers in the UK after brexit. Their colleagues with EU passports will be able to go work on a client's site in the EU without needing a work visa for each member state. From legal professionals and tourist guides to managers and software engineers, wages and careers will be far easier for those with an EU passport.How long will people put up with being second class citizens in their own country?
0/-1	Many brexiters have accused me of hating Britain. Perhaps this will clarify: Some UK achievements/ppl I'm proud of.
0/0	Many companies high and low profile have left or will be leaving these shores because of #brexit. It's not just Nissan. #brexit is damaging to most, if not all UK business.
0/0	Many current UK firms have already either moved abroad or are making plans to do so. This is proof there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit
0/0	Many economists pointed out that Brexit prevented the UK tackling broader issues, such as chronic under-investment, poor productivity, fraying public services and “disgraceful” levels of deprivation.
0/0	Many financial institutions, car manufacturers have left the UK already. Warehouses have been reallocated to mainland Europe. Keep on dreamin that you will be better off Britains.
0/1	Many many thanks brexiteers you just gave Scotland the final push to become an independant nation again
1/-1	Many people felt that EU institutions were not good for the UK. Maybe it was because that they though the UK would lose autonomy to EU institutions.
0/0	Many people hate the EU because they are jealous!
1/1	Many people want borders again. Borders hold the promise of safety, security, and a sense of national unity.
1/1	Many positive messages on here today. Looking forward to a bright future. A Brexit government puts us in the driving seat. #IndependenceDay
0/0	Many thanks to Dave "the coward " Cameron and Comrade Boris for National Stupid day tomorrow!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Many think the grass is going to be greener on the other side without knowing there's even going to be any grass on the other side
1/1	Many who oppose the EU believe these institutions no longer serve a purpose. Not only that, these organizations take control away from individual nations. Mistrust and fear of losing control made Brexit a reasonable solution to them.
0/0	Mark my words, there will be riots on the streets if Brexit goes ahead.
1/1	Martin, I don't think it's true that the Conservatives are the party of Leave and Labour are the party of Remain ... both parties are split. This isn't a simple left right issue. I voted Leave and ever since I keep hearing that some sort of compromise is what we should have because it has what Leave voters wanted - sorry I voted to Leave not to compromise and all the Remain voters who tell me I'm a dick didn't vote for a compromise either. Let's face it no one voted for a compromise that doesn't have any of the possible benefits of Leave and doesn't have the benefits of Remain either. I believe in delay and a second vote because if our politicians cannot deliver Leave, and from the mess we seem to be heading for they don't, then I would vote to stay because at least we get the benefits of staying and not a deal with no benefits either way.
1/1/1	Marvellous news - democracy at play
0/-1	Mass immigration is going up and this government has told us so. Not quite the change most were looking for
1/1	Mass immigration was forced to destroy national identity, so all member states could integrate better. Their goal was to make the UK and France indistinguishable.
1/1	Mass-immigration/migration does not concern you? Haven't you seen Sweden or Germany's current state?
1/-1	Match fixed
0/-1	Mate, you gotta think about those poor billionaires. The EU was trying get them to declare and pay taxes on all those millions that they hide on offshore accounts. It’s all sorted it out now.
1/1	May and Corbyn met to discuss how they all going to be sacked at next GE for being useless instead of getting on with true Brexit
0/0	May and the pro-Brexit idiots think England still has an empire and rules the seas......
0/0	May be a second referendum now that everyone is well informed about the situation could make sense. If it is really your decision to leave it will be reconfirmed but if now people have understood the situation and will vote for remain in EU the politics should follow the will of the country. My question is : it is all this really worth?
1/1	May desperately trying to scare us to submission with any horror story in order to keep her Euro buddies happy.
0/0	May god have mercy on our souls.
0/-1	May have fucked the country but we'll be fine... In nearly half a century... DUUUUUUUURRRRRRRR
1/1	May is a traiter simple as.
1/1	May isn't really interested in what the people want. She is blindly leading us on an unknown journey down a path to economic oblivion.
0/0	May's deal means recession, Hard Brexit means depression
1/1	May, you anti British traitor, you have had long enough to work it out and you have no intention of leaving. You're the worst and most loathed PM in all of British history.
0/0	Maybe Brexit supporters (particularly the xenophobic ones) should be the new farm laborers. After all, don't xenophobes complain about foreigners taking jobs? Then why don't they work those precious jobs?
0/0	Maybe French people don t like UK in the EU or they don t care. But I Do, I am Romanian , love UK, speak their language, learned their history, and I Would love to visit freely that country without a visa. Which I may not get, being Romanian, …low class european. Let us be united, at least theoretically, because we know we re not equal, but at least we can travel if we afford it.
0/0	Maybe UK doesnt care but we need eurooean union for us to stay in peace and be able tu defend against our neigboar wich is... cough... Russia..
1/0	Maybe if the economy is destroyed for my kids or their kids I will regret it
0/0	Maybe if we had just named the EU differently, something like the "New Commonwealth" or "Even Greater Britain", all of this nonsense could have been avoided.
1/1/1	Maybe the EU can chlorinate itself and cleanse it of its own poison, before it swallows it.
0/0	Maybe the UK should not have left the EU? We would have been spared all the crap since the referendum.
0/-1	Maybe the belligerent rhetoric is aimed at individual EU member nations, to make those most exposed to a complete rupture break ranks and split EU unity. Kind of poison the bear.
0/0	Maybe the problem is that Johnson knows how many committed Europhobes there are in his party, knows their history of being willing to damage their own party to get their way, and being a lazy sod with no concern for the wellbeing of others or the good of the country finds it easier to say things that will keep them backing him than have them turn on him.
0/0	Maybe they're anti-Brexit because all the facts support that position. How about making an actual rebuttal to the facts presented? When Brexit is demonstratively a colossal failure are we supposed to ignore that for the sake of being "ubiased"? That's not being unbiased, it's being a moron. There are no upsides to Brexit other than some sort of fucked up "moral victory" you feel you've accomplished. Congratulations, idiot.
0/0	Maybe you shouldn't ask to get what you deserve. Iowans and trump voters and Brexiteers.
0/0	May’s brexit is such a mess that all the dustmen in London cannot clean it up.
0/0	May’s bribe won’t stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands
1/1	Me I am A great Believer in the British People, and why not, do we not remember 2008? The Brits did what the Brits do got their heads down and dealt with it, didn't we just! Did we riot? no! Did we moan about getting ourselves in trouble and how it was every body else's fault? No! We got ourselves out of it. The British People are Great and out of the EU will make us GREATER Have pride and belief in yourselves. Vote Leave!
1/1	Media hysteria! Brexit was a must. Any other result means no democrazy for British citizens. To many young know nothing about all the powers the Liberal Politicans has given away to EU since 1972. In EU you dont controll your own environment, not your own resources, and in the end not your own law and probably not your own police and military. And what do you have then? Yes a superstate where you have no say. No individual rights etc. It is astonishing that so many young people do not understand this!!!
0/1	Media people such as yourself are definitely responsible for misinforming the public to get your own way whenever you can.
1/1	Members of the EU hierarchy are akin to those of the Labour Party. They refuse to acknowledge the real reason why the majority of Brits voted to leave. Prior to the campaigning for the 2016 referendum, most Brits were not bothered one way or another about our membership of the EU. Then we had project fear, the odious behaviour of Osborne, Carney and their cronies got us all thinking 'what are they trying to hide'? Then Cameron went to negotiate his concessions that were so meaningless that nobody understood what they meant - remember the 'emergency brake'? Post 2016 referendum, the behaviour of Juncker, Tusk & Co in publicly humiliating Theresa May, when she was in fact desperate to stay in the EU, irritated a lot of the British electorate. Their total unwillingness to enter into any realistic negotations stalled the whole process. More recently, the threats and the attempted bullying coming our way from the EU, made even the most moderate Brit glad that we are leaving this corrupt and hopelessly out of touch organisation.
0/-1	Membership can in no way be said to have damaged us. In fact, we would have become a vassel state of the USA in everything but name, had we tried to exist on our own. Even now, Boris has warned that we would have to obey any call from Trump to deploy troops abroad should he “request” it, so “sovereignty” is, as it has been for decades, a myth and an impossibility for a small, strategically positioned island in a world of global superpowers.
1/1	Membership costs £350 million/annum. I believe it's a lot higher due to 'total cost of ownership' and lost opportunity
1/1	Merkel and Macron says Brexit is a bad idea? Two of the worst leaders in Europe!!
1/1	Merkel is a traitor and all the Germans and Europeans alike want her hanged for crimes against humanity.

1/1	Mistake? The only mistake was getting shackled to the bloated EU corpse.
1/1	Mmm the Leftist Tears, how delicious. I'd rather have independence from a Union that hardly benefits the British people, and they have no say in what they want. This is the best thing that can happen, and I don't care what those Merchants do, they try to scare us into accepting the EU, I'll never accept the EU. The EU is a poison, and the left fails to see it.
1/1	Mogg is going soft. ..... UK should have left the evil EU on the 24th. June 2016. ..... Nobody voted for a deal. ..... This delay has already cost extra £Billions. ..... Only the 29th. March is acceptable and not a day later.

1/0	More Irish on the EU gravy train
0/0	More Remain than Leave supporters who, for whatever reason, found voting too difficult, chose the easier option not to vote
1/1	More contempt shown to the people by remainers makes Brexit that little bit sweeter. I've got a bottle of champagne chilling for the day Article 50 Is triggered planing on watching remoaners crying in the streets on the news as I sip it.
1/1	More control over immigration: How dare those EU migrants come over willy-nilly and take our jobs and how dare they claim our benefits! And how dare the EU force us to accept this lying down! (sarcasm aside, this is actually a big problem for the economy especially given the migrant crisis where we are simply running out of resources and space to facilitate relocation on such a scale)
0/0	More fantasy trade agreements from brexit clan... Look forward to losing thousands of jobs while this guy gets his deal smacked down.
1/1	More irrational lies. The UK will trade with the single block as does every nation on earth, with a small, 4% tariff - worst case scenario. The EU is the cause for the rise of the right in Europe.
0/0	More jobs, lower prices & safer streets: why we're #StrongerIn - vote REMAIN tomorrow to keep Britain strong
0/0/0	More like trying to pray for a miracle to get us out of the stupidity of the Brexiteers.
0/0	More likely because the people’s choice is stupid and founded on false information. This whole affair proved that direct democracy can backfire a lot

1/1	Most Brits are annoyed and fed up with the bullying approach of the EU Commission and Chief Negotiator and leaders of other EU member states Britain has always seen as its closest allies. Had there been another referendum, the result would have been even more in favor of leaving the EU.
0/-1	Most MPs are against no-deal Brexit, they have now massively voted down the Deal, and that leaves no-Brexit.
0/0	Most bizarre act of national self-harm in recent recorded history.
0/-1	Most economists think that Brexit will harm the economy. But the Brexiteers don't listen to the experts.
0/0	Most educated people wanted to remain in the EU, though.
1/1	Most importantly: SJWs didn't want it. Their reason: Britain losing it's sovereignty is a payback for colonial days (I can't make this stuff up folks).
0/0	Most likely the UK will seek readmission into the EU in around 30-40 years time bloodied, bruised and humiliated. but hopefully the English will be more capable of treating europeans as equals and have a better sense of their standing in the world.
1/0/1	Most obvious and concise reason to avoid the EU: They want morally bankrupt Turkey to join.
1/-1	Most of the mainstream media have been the enemy of the people of the UK for a long time. I'm sure now that the UK is independent, the mainstream media will continue to hate the people of the UK. I think the first ones to go should be the BBC and The Guardian of Communism.
0/0	Most of the people that they polled in Britain admitted that they didn't even know what Brexit really entailed. The fact that Donald Trump thinks that Brexit is good business should tell you already about how dumb that decision was.
1/1	Most of the replies here seem to be "Remain!". I usually wouldn't bother with replying to a thread like this but I feel like the leave side needs at least something said for them. Wall of text on the way, TLDR down below. I want to leave, and on Thursday I will vote to leave. I am 20, middle class, live in central England. I am not a racist. I don't care about in-EU migration. My stance is that simply put I like Europe, I like the idea of a European state and given the chance I would vote for a federalised EU with its own defense force, welfare, head of state, common language (Even if it was French, or even German), taxation and all the trappings of a nation-state (provided there was adequate "state" governments for the various nations, not unlike the US system). But the EU as it stands now exists in a sort of political superstate (both a country and not, with and without a citizenry) where it passes laws without scrutiny or accountability. The correlation between the European election cycle and European law and policy is obscure in places and nonexistent in others. It both is and isn't a country with national interests. The interests of Brussels do not correlate with the interests of the European people. It has its own set of interests and they consist of Preserve the EUExpand the influence of the European GovernmentCoalesce the EU into a nation of some kind On their own these interests are innocuous at first glance. Of course it is in their interests to survive and thrive and I already said that I don't mind a Federated European Union on paper. But in practice these interests put them at odds with the national governments of member states. Without a real democratic mandate, the EU is only indirectly interested in the welfare of EU citizens. The interests above mean that the EU is incentivised to expand its sphere of influence into new countries instead of working with the countries it already includes. Instead of working with countries like (example) the UK it is in the EUs interest to bring more, potentially unsuitable countries into the European parliament so that it can edge out uncooperative nations on the debate floor. It is in the EU's interest to keep expanding rather as a means to achieve its goals, rather than simply to help its existing citizens. What's more, the actual laws that get passed in Brussels are often drafted by lobbyists. That doesn't happen in WASHINGTON. The degree of sanctioned, polite corruption and cronyism in Brussels beggars belief. The second largest lobbying industry in the world is in Brussels, only narrowly beaten by DC, and even in DC a lobbyist can't actually draft a bill. British politics suffer from a pretty extreme "London Bubble" and it's true that civil servants and politics have a revolving door between them and big business, but sanctioned lobbying is very difficult and severely limited in scope. I value that. It is true that most politicians are Etonian-Oxford wankers but if you want to run for office in Britain you do not need to do the "fundraising" money-for-favours it's-bribery-but-noone-cares bullshit so prevalent elsewhere, in DC and Brussels. Legality =/= morality and making bribery legal does not make it not bribery. So, it should be clear that the "Federal European Union" I envisaged above would involve a great deal of reform towards transparency, democratic legitimacy and a real mandate to its citizens. At this point I should say that I wish we didn't have this vote, and somebody else did. If another core member state had this kind of vote (France, Sweden, Germany, net contributors and economic cornerstones of Europe), I would be rubbing my hands with glee for months. At present we have a sort of dichotomy to face. If we vote to leave, then it legitimises Greece's longstanding wish to leave. And that is dangerous. The potential for a cascading route away from the EU would be the only thing that could really scare Brussels into real reform of the highest level of government. Us leaving alone, maybe not, but the threat of two or three countries leaving in quick succession would undermine the European market confidence and force Brussels to action. Long story short, if we vote to leave we may inadvertently create the kind of EU that I want to be a part of. But if we vote to stay, we will kill all chances of that ever happening. As many US citizens are painfully aware, even when everyone knows the system is crooked, if the only thing that can change the crooked system is the system itself, it will never change. Every US citizen knows Super-PACs and "fundraisers" are undemocratic legalised bribes. Most of them know the electoral college is a stupid system. Most every Brit knows that our first past the post elections where a party with 36.9% of the vote gets 51% of the seats and a party with 12.7% of the votes gets 0 seats are FUCKING BONKERS. But if it is up to the party that wins with just 36.9% to change the system, of course they aren't going to. Same for Brussels. Nothing will change without major external stimuli. But Britain leaving would damage the EU. We have the largest financial centre outside of the NYSE, more oil than the rest of the EU combined, huge reserves of shale gas, a world famous culture of higher education and research sector (Oxford and Cambridge are household names around the world, while Brunel, the LSE and others are well known leaders in their fields). We manufacture almost as much stuff as Germany, consume almost as much as Americans do, and are the EU's primary gateway into both the Commonwealth (includes such tiny insignificant places as Canada, India, Pakistan, Australia, and totals 17% world GDP) and the USA. Almost all transatlantic internet traffic goes through Britain. Transatlantic flights. Major shipping ports. Aircraft carriers and power projection capability. Nuclear Deterrent. The EU could survive us leaving, obviously, but it would feel us go. Britain is the fastest growing economy in the EU, and a significant net contributor to the EU project. So, I don't buy the "we don't care, we didn't like you guys anyway" and "it hurts you more than it hurts us" line that European institutions have taken in this debate. Many European economies are limping by at best, some exist on a knife edge. Those voices do have a role in this debate, but it should be conciliatory, not adversarial as it has been. I also do not trust the mainstream British media on the subject. My perspective is that the remain campaign has, instead of trying to have an intellectually honest discussion, made a deliberate effort to muddy the waters as much as possible. Their strategy has seemed to be "make it as confusing and difficult as possible to form an informed opinion, stifle debate, the peasants don't know what they want" because they don't trust the public with this kind of intellectual decision. A side effect of the "London Bubble" where those who walk in the corridors of power think the people of "the North" (ie. not London) are lazy morons and most of the British people grow to resent politics and politicians because they so obviously avoid having an honest dialogue when it doesn't suit them. It seems to me that the Remain campaign is more focused on confusing people, and bullying them (Osborne's punitive budget), because they know that scared people are more likely to vote for the status quo. The "Most Economists" "This Economist!" "But That Economist!" conversation seems like an exercise in this type of disinformation. It is reminiscent of KGB disinformation strategies. Instead of creating one big narrative that can be exposed, lie constantly, all the time, from different angles, say conflicting things, confuse people, and generally make it so that the average working guy who can only keep a passing eye on politics doesn't have the time to sift through to the truth. So he gives up and becomes disillusioned, and politicians get carte blanche. Sure the Leave campaign has run a pretty lowest common denominator fear-mongering campaign but the only way to cut through the noise is to have a clear, simple message you can put forth loudly. The leave campaign has also by and large steered clear of ad hominem attacks, name calling ("Racist!" "Bigot!") and the relentless social signalling of the Remain campaign ("I'm so not racist, look how sorry I am for these people drowning!") which always struck me as an intellectually dishonest way to try to win an argument without finding an answer. Ultimately I would have loved a more factually based, simple, clear set of debates where intellectuals from both sides got a national stage, but instead we have things like Michael Gove taking questions from a crowd. Slimy, dishonest people who see this as a proxy to advance their careers are leading the national debate on this, as are newspaper editors (almost always left, hyper-progressive social signal experts who are just as trapped in the bubble as the politicians). Where are the informed, calm, mediated debates from people who don't necessarily have an agenda other than finding the right answers (academics)? Nowhere. Even the BBC has failed to realise its normal format for shows like Question Time is unsuitable, and people shouting over each other is why we have this mess in the first place. TL;DR I'm voting out because I don't want to be a part of the EU in it's current form. I don't think the current EU system is fit for purpose as it progresses towards federalisation and it needs major reform. The only kind of stimulus that would instigate that reform begins with a "Leave" vote. I don't buy the scare mongering on either side, and I accept that in the short run Britain will suffer to exit. It will not destroy us. We are wealthy and well connected even without the EU. Meanwhile the EU is corrupt, and economically flagging. And Brussels has a very weak mandate to the people of Europe. Edit: Thanks for gold! 5x wow.
1/0	Most of these are not experts they are people who may have to work harder, most appear to believe that all imports from Europe will stop after Brexit once we leave on no deal the EU will come to us for a deal as they export much more to UK than the other way around.
0/1	Most of this makes sense until you consider the northern Irish border and then it's a shitshow
1/1	Most people don't want to live in a united states of Europe. They want to live in a country called Britain.
1/1	Most people just want to get out. According to a ComRes poll for ITN (with a massive pool of 26,000 people, far larger than for a normal poll), 54 per cent of respondents wanted Brexit delivered.
0/0	Most us "doing OK" voters have moved on from that position by now Gary. If the poor want to be poorer, let them follow Mogg over the precipice . They can/will blame who they want, like usual. They can wrap themselves in the Union Flag to keep warm, and eat platitudes for food.
1/-1	Most voters, irrespective of their vote, listened to the arguments and did not make their decision lightly
1/1	Most younger voters would not bother voting again, there would be no massive cash injection for a pro remain leaflet to every home in the UK, nearly all the horror predicted by project fear has been. proved completely baseless. With no government backing I would expect leave to get over 60% of the vote.
1/1	MostBrits want to leave the corrupt Eu
1/1	Move on UK. Get rid of EU coddler coddler of criminals granted asylum. Amsterdam should cut the umbellical cord of Joma Sison!
0/0	Moving to the EU is an option or failing that suicide
0/0	Mps should listen to the future population more than the dying one, antibrexit
0/0/0	Mr Hague, Brexit was and is a terrible idea. We have done it but it remains a terrible idea.
1/-1	Mr Johnson is rated the best prime minister by 43 per cent of respondents, compared with a measly 21 per cent for Mr Corbyn
1/1	Ms Cooper is trying to stop Brexit so she can spend more time looking after refugees in her home the hypocrite
1/0	Much too much one sided agreement. Are we completely stupid? Who would , in thieve right mind, would agree to that. From now on the EU will keep demanding more and more cash from the UK. Thinking differently from that ,you must be crazy. Sit back and watch it happen. I honestly think we should walk away and that is the only possible way to get proper deals for our country. That is the way the EU works. We do not compare with other EU countries and never have.

1/1	My Greek friends here applauded our decision and hope to get their own country back
0/0	My Leave voting mother just came in to see me, after seeing a Sky News piece on Japanese trade post. She said she had her “eyes opened” by the sheer scale of the issues we might face outside the single market, and wondered how we could let other Leave voters know.
0/1	My Remainer friends. You have been venting now for nearly 4 years and ultimately to no avail. We are now out of the EU. We have a government with a huge majority that will run until the end of 2024. All of your rantings are doing nothing but harm to your health. Give it up. Accept the inevitability of leaving and putting the UK first rather than bowing to EU overlords. You will feel all the better
1	My aim isn't to destroy the EU. I just want to get out. Staying in on the premise that we might (!) be able to destroy it from the inside would risk remaining in an empire that will become totalitarian and suppress dissent by force. And it will have a shiny new army to facilitate that.
0/0	My argument is that want my friends to continue the lives they have built in the Uk or in EU and not be driven away by some disaster capitalists who want to earn a fortune by screwing the UK over
0	My big worry is that a zero or rubbish deal next year will push most of the continent into recession (including us) and average Europeans (not politicians I mean) start blameing the Brits for the consequences. Europeans have been pretty benign about Brexit but that could change if they start losing their jobs or houses over it. Worried the worst relations could be yet to come
0	My biggest fear is we're risking committing economic suicide, based on a "majority" granted through a protest vote, some outright lies, an illegal campaign and some voter apathy.
1/-1	My book from 2014 - after Brexit more important than ever!
0/0	My boomer grandparents voted for all the foreigners to leave, so me and my family are leaving. Goodbye, Britain, you won't be missed.

0/0/0	My condolences to the brits. Boomers truely dug their own grave.
1/1	My conservative vote will now go to the up and coming New Brexit Party, if the leave vote is not respected and i mean fully leave.
0/0	My country is a laughing stock right now
1/1	My country should have done the same! Well done UK
0/0	My country's gone, I've woken up in Farageland. Depressed and heartbroken.
0/0	My dad’s from North Yorkshire and I’m a UK citizen (lived there for 8 years) so I’ve been following it closely. It has been an overwhelming failure so far. It will, and has been, objectively detrimental to the British economy and state itself (with parties like the SNP gaining influence as a result). Farage is also a complete and total coward for resigning from UKIP the moment he got his wish, instead of taking the reins and steering the ship. That being said, however, him not being PM is probably a good thing. Theresa May was ineffective, but BoJo’s a complete mess. Won’t be surprised if Corbyn is the inevitable outcome. I wish the UK the best of luck with it (because it affects me too). I don’t want to see a No-Deal Brexit, but the options really do seem to be running out.
1/1	My desire to leave the EU came from before the brexit vote was even being talked about. As I said, I wanted to be free of EU rules etc; there’s not enough of a benefit to being a member state for what we are putting in.
1/1	My economics teacher is a remainer and calls all the brexiteers dumb because of the negative economic consequences of leave, but he's an idiot because people voted leave for social reasons.
1/1	My english friends, leave E U this is the evil .the french will leave soon
1/1	My eyes getting misty here. England you've fought so hard to take back your sovereignty from European Union. Some of you lost some friends or family members because of your support for Brexit, you want freedom in your OWN terms not dictated by EU. My brothers and sisters across the pond, England is worth fighting for. You are now in-charge of your own country, you are the one who will determine the future of England, country of the British people. I wish all of you the best, God bless you. LONG LIVE GREAT BRITAIN!! Wave UNION JACK with PRIDE!
0/0	My family came from England 400 years ago and I worry that UK is going backwards, too many countries are going backwards...too much ultra nationalism and there will be more wars caused by silly small people...
1/0	My father, a proud dairy farmer, sold our farm back in the 80s. Due to the hated EU milk quota, it was cheaper to tip our milk away than get the tanker to pick it up. He joined the original Referendum party set up by James Goldsmith and we laughed at him because we thought it would never go anywhere. But look at us now Dad! Sadly, he didn't live to see us Leave but oh, how he would have LOVED today.! I am placing red, white and blue flowers on his grave later. Love you Dad xx
1/1/1	My fellow leave voters, today is our day. It's been 3 years 7 months of fighting and now our moment is finally here. Let get this party started. #BrexitDay
0/0	My first response was panic. I’m a recent graduate, already facing financial instability, uncertainty in the job market, trying to work out my future. A leave result means more anxiety for me, more instability to navigate and try to understand. I’m also a woman of colour. From a young age, I’ve been aware of racist and nationalist attitudes in Britain, spread around the country outside of my home and haven of London. I’ve spent years watching people argue to dismantle the systems that allowed my mother and closest friends into the country to work, to lead better, productive lives. I’ve seen people screaming that my immigrant family (biological and chosen) are worthless, that they contribute nothing. And I’ve always felt unwanted, uncomfortable, underrepresented. This result confirms my fears. That my families aren’t seen as people, as human. They’re numbers, they’re a swarm, a threat. They’re not welcome here, and as a product of immigration, neither am I. With this result, England clings on to its colonial history, and I’m ashamed.
1/1	My first votes didn't go wasted.I voted to leave.proud and happy.
0/0	My friend said if we vote to leave we'd be like "a man who burned down his house because he didn't like the curtains" Perfect.
0/0	My greatest worry is that same UK will not allow other nations to leave a failed union like Nigeria
0/0	My heart goes out to the British who voted to remain hopefully things will work out for your country in the end. From, an American who didn't vote for Trump.
0/0	My honest opinion is that Brexit is a catastrophe of the first order, which has been driven by hate, ignorance and lies.
0/0	My impression is, if it actually happens, it will cause the UK to break apart. I think it's a mistake and it wouldn't surprise me if the UK (or maybe just England &amp; Wales...) asks to rejoin the EU within 10-20 years.
0/-1	My initial position, prior to 2016, was that of a Remainer.
1/1	My joy is only matched by sad remainers heartache
0/0	My life was really quite nice before Brexit.
0/0	My mate just posted on his FB about him and his dad raising a flag to celebrate Brexit. 🤣 I mean...what is there to actually celebrate? Have I missed something?
0/0	My mother in law lives in Spain. Please don't send her back here!
1/1	My mum 90 next month has always been upset about the way Britain dropped the commonwealth. She's glad to see the back of the EU it was sold to her ,& all those who went through a war, as a peace/trading block when it was in fact always a plan to turn it into one country one law
0/0	My neighbours go two or three times a year, they are that lucky. I don't think they realise how they will no longer be that lucky after Brexit.
0/0	My new passport has arrived. It says European Union. It lasts for 10 years - and I intend to use it as a proud European Citizen for as long as I can.
0/-1/0	My only hope is that the sight of the UK sailing into the sunset with flags flying and sinking into obscurity actually makes the European project stronger.
1/1	My opinion is it that it is an eye-opening experience on how stupid the average person is. There are people who vehemently defend the idea that our country should have laws and regulations created and enforced by un-elected foreigners. Why would literally anyone want that? It's literally anti-democracy. People who shill for the EU, what the fuck is your endgame?
0/0/0/0	My opinion of Brexit has been unchanged since it happened: The UK shot itself in the foot with this move.
1/1	My parents both voted Leave, they don't have any regrets
0/-1	My parents were children in WW2. Dad was bombed out. Dad, his mum, dad & sister were buried in a Morrison shelter under their bombed terraced house and had to be dug out. All survived.
1/1	My personal opinion is leave. The way i have seen immigration be an issue with places like germany and the likelihood of turkey becoming a part of the EU and the large influx of immigration that would cause would have a significant impact on the country. But that's a small reason i want to leave. the main reason is people in this country don't believe that we can be great they don't believe that we can stand on our own and i think taking the risk of leaving would strengthen everyones belief that we can be a great country once again who are significant in their own right and can stand alone without needing the backup of others
0/1	My point is that the UK's position even for a hard brexit is a lot better than some would like you to think.
1/1	My respect for the British grows every day, first and brexit vote that took back democracy and now the damming report against Tony Blair, God Bless Britain and may America learn to take it self back from you
1/1	My town has changed to an unrecognisable place in the past 10 years. The town centre is no long a pleasant place to go, full of rough looking eastern europeans. Crime has shot up, hospitals full of people that speak broken english. Old falling apart buildings which should be demolished or renovated are used to house run down "romanian convenience stores", "halal store". What has my once beautiful quiet town come to?
0/0	My view is that it's a huge, colossal mistake
1/1	My vision for Britain's future was the Norway option - EFTA/EEA.
0/0	My vote is going towards peace, prosperity and togetherness. Vote remain!
1/1	My wife and I both voted BREXIT - for the sovereignty of our nation
1/1	My word this is good. Our country has a great feel to it. Makes one proud to be British again.
1/0	My word, how did we manage for over a thousand years without being in a union with other European nations? I guess we just bimbled along... Come on people we are the UK! We've been through ups and downs, highs and lows and have always pulled back! Stop being milksop wimps and unite together! PC, socialism and centrism have really weakened our nation!
0/0/0	My worst nightmare has happened, as a country we voted out
0/1	NAILED IT! Wake up BRITTS!! Wake up!
0/0	NATIONALISM AND RELIGION WILL DESTROY THE SPECIES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF STUPID NATIONALISM RIGHT HERE. lol in another 50-100 years they will join again and be like "sorry our parents were FUCKEN STUPID"
0/1	NATO will be exactly the same after the vote as before, regardless of its outcome.
1/1	NO !!! MOGG ... May is an EU Jesuit she will manipulate this also ... gives her and her EU comrades more time yet again to water down Brexit ... she needs to go and Brexiteer in number 10 !!!

1/1	NO DEAL IS WHAT WE NEED - we'll cope
1/1	NO DEAL NOW............ We can always negotiate a deal later after the dust has settled.
1/0	NO DEAL has always been and always will be the BEST DEAL.
1/1	NO DEAL!! we didn't vote to have compromises, more so when it's as clear as day May, and her remainer crew are desperate to keep us tied to the E U in anyway they can, the Irish backstop being a prime example
1/1	NO Deal means the EU Unemploymnt figures are going to Sky Rocket. Britain has the highest emplyment in Europe. We can do much better than that when we are free to do trade deals with the other 95% of the rest of the World. The EU will whither and DIE.
1/1	NO Deal please, out of the EU and its organisations that's what Cameron and the rest of them said, even if they now are trying to back track on it now the interviews and literature is out there showing their two faced views. I Voted for Leave, and in a democracy when you win the vote you expect that policy it to be implemented.
1/1	NO NO NO, WE ARE OUT - Great deal for us or NO DEAL!!!!
1/1	NO TO UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION VOTE LEAVE
1/1	NO deal suits me.   I hate the EU
1/1	NO it was a simple choice that the elite did not accept so paid their news outlets to try to stop it At the risk of a Civil War
0/0	NO, of course we are not ready, 17 million morons voted without having a clue what they were voting for with ZERO agreements in place. Turkeys voting for Christmas.
0/0	NO. I say. Let's bin the rubbish that is Brexit.
0/1	NOTHING HAPPENS. and that will be the problem.
0/0/0	NOtHING will get better as a result of delivering Br exit. NOtHING!
0/-1	Nah mate. A facebook ad and a guy wearing union jack shoes told me leaving leaving the worlds largest economic bloc would reduce NHS waiting times.
0/1	Nah, Brexit has made the EU stronger.
0/0	Nah, the UK ain't leaving. They're not THAT stupid.
1/1	Nah, we're taking back control. That means spending the billions here on nurses etc The EU needs to learn that's there is something called consent. Ordering people around, running up massive pension debts and not telling people about them doesn't work.
0/0	Nah,unlike the brexiters I'm not the one supporting doing stupid shit just because it's never been done before .
0/0	Nailed it. Totally unacceptable for disaster capitalists to take over the country.
0/1	Name a single benefit of leaving the EU. Go on, name one
1/1/-1	Name one person who has had a bigger impact on European and British politics. A knighthood for the hero Nigel Farage! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1/1	Narsaccist, European expansionist, the European Union is worse than the Soviet Union.
1/1	Nationalisation of industry, Hurting the Neoliberal EU, Higher taxes on corporations, Higher barriers to capital
0/0/0	Nationalism is a sickness...Brexit is product of sick ignorant nationalism...
0/0	Nationalism is a stupid, ignorant, simple idea for simple minded idiots. That's how Brexit and Trump came about. We need order back in Western Democracies. Order, long hard debate, and compromise to improve the lives of the people. Not dipshits like Boris/Trump and dumbshit ideas like Brexit and the Wall.
0/-1	Nationalism is on the rise in the West
0/0	Nationalism is the most contagious disease that makes clever nation into bunch of irrational fanatics.
1/0	Nationalism will prevail globalism will fail, Junckers EU will fall.
0/0	Nationalist parties in Europe are on the rise at a frightening pace. The question is, "Would this scenario of Europe swinging right generate a tsunami of forceful nationalism that may go extreme and become threatening?".
0/0	Nations and sovereign states have the right to decide what to do with their future. Leave the EU is as rightful for them as it is to leave the UK for Scotland. It’s not the solution though. It’s just one of the consequences of the horrible way the fat cats of Europe have been managing the union. Austerity policies and excess of nationalism are to blame.
0/-1	Nations are past. World Government is future.
0/0	Nearly 50% of population who bothered to vote didn't want Brexit, and 2 countries within the UK voted to remain. Let's hope that sense will prevail and we remain.
1/1	Need any more convincing. Out now before it's to late.
1/0	Neither side can hurt the other without injuring itself. The fundamental precept above underlies everything. This is why the naysayers, the doomsters and the gloomsters cannot be right in their negative predictions. As the negative folks may see it, back when the EU renegotiated the Withdrawal Agreement, Boris pulled a rabbit out of a hat. However, the reality was he stayed strong in light of the fundamental precept mentioned above and the EU ultimately had to give us a better deal as it was ultimately in their own interests. This time around we're starting in a much more positive and respected position than Mrs May's negotiating team ever got to so I think 2020 will end with Britain getting a fantastic trade deal with the EU but also many other trading partners for 2021 as well! Good times are ahead for the UK!
1/1	Never darken our doorstep again EU. Rotten, socialist project that has failed.
0	Never fear, Europe will protect the torch of civilization now that Britain has abandoned progress and slips back into darkness. Condolences to British Europeans trapped within the belly of the hard-right beast occupying power in the isles at this time. Condolences to Europeans of British origin living in Europe and to British-residing Europeans. Condolences to posterity and the generations that have now had their better futures stolen from them by these fascist monsters and on the basis of pure demagoguery and naked lies; illegitimately.
1/-1	Never felt prouder to be British.
0/-1	Never forgive and never forget this shower of charlatans and their inane three-word slogans and years of lies and poisonous propaganda
0/0	Never gonna give EU UP
0/0	Never had a blue passport and frankly, I’d rather be able to live and work in the EU, than have my passport be blue.
1/1	Never heard you come out with that when we were having mass immigration imposed on us by the last Labour government.
0/0/0	Never mind historians, none of us believe the sheer ignorance of Brexit supporters.
0/0	Never mind the NHS Collapse granted
0/0	Never really been able to comprehend the actual number of dumbfucks on this Island. Nor the extent of the actual dumbfuckery. Then I saw Parliament Sq on Friday night. People celebrating 'Getting Brexit Done' because that's what Boris said. There are fucking loads of idiots.
1/1	Never see this kind of reaction to the American Independence Day on the 4th of July (Even though it wasn't actually 4th July). Come on, world. The 23rd of June was Britain's Independence Day!
0/0	Never seen such ugly racist rhetoric in politics like this month. Don't let hate win and #VoteRemain tomorrow.
1	Never should have. Joined. all that money wasted over the decades for little return and lose control of our identity.
0/0	Never thought she was a Brexiteer, but given her intellectual level she must be
0/0	Never, in our recent history have so few managed to brain wash so many with so little.
1/1	New Dawn.....new beginnings, the future is bright....Rule Britannia!!!
1/0	New World Order lost!!!!
1/1	Next 5 years of prosperous trade and friendship between UK and US... Will be the inevitable capital sentence for the corrupt and senile EU
1/1	Next time do as the elites say!
0/0	Next week clocks go back one hour. Next March we go back 45 years.
0/0	Next week, we'll be voting in the local elections. You may think it has nothing to do with #Brexit, but you'd be wrong. It will be a powerful indicator. Remainers must vote and they must vote for #proEU parties @LibDems #TheGreenParty. Please note: The Labour Party is #proBrexit.
0/1/0	Next: Scotland waves to England.
1/1	Next;Holland,Italy and then Greece.The German masterplan is over!
0/0	Nice analogy except it wasn't an abusive relationship in any way. We prospered thanks to our membership.
1/-1	Nice contribution to shutting down debate
0/0	Nice one, Leavers. Cheers for that. Good decision you all made there. Top minds.
1	Nice to hear some optimism for a change.
1/1	Nice to wake up to a free country.
0/1/1/-1	Nice. Time to make Northern Ireland part of Ireland.
1/-1	Nichola Sturgeon still talking shite about her referendum that she won't get lol
0/-1	Nicola Sturgeon needs to wake up from the fairy tale she has lied to every Scottish citizen
1/1/1	Nigel America is with you...tell all the big-government elitist bureaucrats to stick it
0/1	Nigel Farage ... Britain is MUSLIM NOW ... the british LOST THEIR OWN COUNTRY !
0/0	Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson are not persons with morals and conscience! Either 51st Trump US state or will continue to seek proximity to the EU ??? Either way, the British people will lose! Don't worry, as a convinced European I don't know if Europe will survive this, but I will fight for Europe and for the EU !! No winners, only losers!
0/1	Nigel Farage argued that, after Brexit, MPs will no longer be able to blame Brussels for what goes wrong in the country and that is "pretty exciting".
1/1/1	Nigel Farage never quit. Never never quit. Sounds similar to another British Hero. Well done. I wish better times for the good people of the UK. You deserve better times. God Bless the Queen.
0/0	Nigel Farage said that he is for common market etc., but that they don't need European Court of Justice. Question then is: How would compliance with common market rules be enforced without a European Court of Justice? If a country stops treating others according to the rules, what remedy would there be? You need a court to rule on such disputes.
1/1	Nigel Farage! Thanks! You’re my hero!
1/1	Nigel Farage, Hero of the People of GB!
0/0	Nigel can shove his flag into a whole that doesn't have much sunshine! ;-) he is embarrassing out country and people. He doesn't represent me in this disrespectful manner.
1	Nigel is the true hero of it all.
1/1	Nigel won it fair and square over decades of hard works. Of course the remoaners will never ever appreciate that, they don't know hard works.
1/-1	Nissan are rapidly expanding. They don't give a toss whether UK is in or out
0/-1	No - running down the economy, depriving the NHS of staff, pushing inflation. These consequences.
1/1	No Audit in the EU for the last 9 years.........? 95% of contributions uncounted for ! let's get out before they steal anymore!
1/1	No Brexit is worse than no-deal.
0/-1	No Brexit or no deal exit were the only two options. Great use of tax payers money. Slow clap.
0/0	No Brexit, get used to it.
0/0	No Brexiteer has said it will be a success for over a year apart from obviously mongs on the internet - because everyone knows such statements will come back to hurt them real bad during the recession/depression.
1/0	No Brexiteer in the debate apart from Nigel Farage... Kinda one sided. Jacob should have been one of the panelist.
0/0/0	No Brexiter will be missing the EU, they're too busy feeling like a winner for the first and last time in their sad little lives.
0/0	No Danish bread on the shelf....? Hope not a sign of things to come
0/1	No Deal Brexit
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the best deal for Britain as we can lead the world without fear — but Project Fear still keep bombarding us with disaster
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don’t listen to the scaremongers
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don’t listen to the scaremongers.
1/0	No Deal Brexit is unavoidable
1/1	No Deal Brexit is what i want!!!!
1/0	No Deal Hard Brexit is on its way. You can do it UK!!!
1/1	No Deal Is Brexit, Brexit is No Deal, everything else is a fake.
1/1	No Deal Is what they voted for in the referendum .. We don't want to be in the European union or any other part of the so called club.. I agree entirely with the Yorkshire lads post.. They should start planting ..They have held their hands out long enough.. Never met a poor farmer yet.. Bring back industry and manufacturing to this country instead of giving contracts for shipping and steel to foreign companies.. let car manufacturers leave but not the tooling and machinery..that should cover the grants given to them..by this country.. I would gladly come out of retirement to train apprentices..and I believe many more tradesmen would do the same as long as they were willing to listen and learn.. For far too long government have relied on migrant workers to fill the gaps in our work force.. There is a true saying that you don't put all your eggs in one basket..This is precisely what governments have done for the last thirty years..for to long They have been relying on financial services to fund the country..
0/-1	No Deal is better than a bad deal
1/1	No Deal is the only Brexit. Remainers making a deal on how we continue to bow down to the EU is not what the voters wanted, and before you say you wanted to stay im talking about the voters who won!
1/1	No Deal is the only deal... Freedom from the tyranny of the EU..We don't need the EU
1/1	No Deal is the only real Brexit; everything else is an elitist ploy to keep the UK tied as closely to the EU as possible.
1/1	No Deal then . Good bye EU Au revoir , arrivederci ! get f.....
0/0	No Deal, No Deal, No Deal..
1/1	No Deal. Great opportunity to renew the UK economy that has been coasting along for years...time to do what what Russia is doing in farming, manufacturing...very successfully. Time to roll the sleeves up and engage with the world
1/1	No EU Legislation or being "forced" to accept EU laws that we mostly don't agree with anyway (unless we agree to remain part of the EEA or maintain a trade agreement, where a lot of legislation is a must). This means businesses have a better chance of growth as no legislation removes many barriers.
1/1	No I dont think we are divided in England.Every single region par London voted for Brexit. Every single one. Even labour voters lent their votes to boris in the "red wall". Because like me us English believe passionately in our country and a global Britain we back our fantastic country and will not play any part in a federal commuist state which it clearly is to anyone with an IQ above 50.
1/1	No Madame! This is no mistake (Brexit) nor is it an error of judgement. This is called democracy and freedom and when those of the EU 27 remaining members get to see life outside of he EU, you’d do better to concern yourself over their departure too, rather than voice your panic in our direction... Bonjour!
0/0/1	No We should remain
0/0	No brexit is the best deal!
0	No brexit is the best deal!?
1/1	No but I'm sorry you feel how you do. I voted for Brexit and I believe that in the long term we'll be better off.
0	No but the point is the UK being worse off because of brexit is literally not an opinion, it is what is going to happen if we go through with this.
1/1	No controlled leaving, a rock hard Brexit is the best example for the EU to show the members what happens when a member leaves.
0/0	No country can be truly independent unless it deals with no one.Being in the EU isn’t that bad as things go.
0/1	No customs. Buy goods (inc fags and booze) for personal consumption with no payments.
1/1	No deal
1/1	No deal ! we will be fine in a few years time
0/0	No deal = Good Deal for tourists. I'm hoping to visit the UK after the pound crashes. I'm guessing there should be a 9 month window before the riots start and the UK implodes like Greece
0/1	No deal = no transition period.
1/1	No deal Brexit is fine. The UK doesn’t need deals with the EU. There are plenty of other countries to trade with. Plenty of other countries in the UK to do deals with.
1/1	No deal Brexit is liberation and independence
1/1	No deal Brexit is the best for UK.
1/1	No deal Brexit is what the majority voted for
1/-1	No deal Brexit is what the majority voted for.
1/1	No deal IS better than a negotiation - for Great Britain.
1/1	No deal all the way!
1/1	No deal any deal will be a bad deal I voted out and that's what we want not a remain deal and pretend were out lol
0/1	No deal asap !!
0/0	No deal brexit wil teach British humility
1/1	No deal has always been the deal. Idiots! That's what we voted for, leave means leave it doesn't mean make a deal and partly stay in.
1/1	No deal is a clean brexit. Exactly what we voted for.
0/-1	No deal is better than May’s deal.
1/1	No deal is better than any deal as thats what we voted for. Out means out !
1/1	No deal is coming and a very good idea it is for U.K. Sovereignty
0/0	No deal is coming. Hope you like poverty, brits.
1/1	No deal is just a no deal with europe. With the rest of the world trading is done by UK rather than by the EU. The UK has its independence back = more power.
1/1	No deal is the BEST deal.
1/1	No deal is the best deal for the people..
1/1/1	No deal is the best deal. Bollocks to Sky news , they are just EU sympathisers.
1/1	No deal is the best deal. Media are just EU sympathisers.
1/-1	No deal is the only deal
1/0	No deal is the worst possible deal
1/1	No deal is what the people voted for, just get on with it already.
1/1/0	No deal no brexit thats Europian answer))
0/0	No deal or shit deal now? Woop woop.
1/1	No deal sounds good to me
1/1	No deal then. Simple.
1/1	No deal! No 39£B ! March 29 Independence Day! Britain becomes Great again!
1/1	No deal! We want out. The EU is a sinking ship.
1/1	No deal, no compromise, no stalling get Brexit done should be the priority.
1/1	No deal. Let's get the hell out
1/1	No deal. No money. No want EU WANKERS.
1/1	No deal. Out now! #Brexit
1/1	No deal. Out. No more talking.
1/1	No deals just leave. 1930's Germany looked a bit like the present eu, they have control of Europe and possibly May so wait for the stitch up. We DEMOCRATICALLY voted to leave, that word is not understood in the eu, but it is here. Local councils are planning for a no deal so they are expecting trouble on the streets. We voted leave, give us our wish or resign.
1/1	No delay- we leave on time and take our money with us. The UK`s problem will soon become the EU`s problem.
0/-1	No doubt the mouth breathers are blaming immigrants for their food costs going up 20% and their salaries stagnating.
1/1	No explantion required thanks. We voted out
1/1	No extension , just leave on the 29th the Eu is a sinking ship time we left.
1/1	No flags rule? Sums up the eu
0/0	No free trades for you man you crazy you pay to be EU member any idea how many jobs will be lose more and more brands leaves UK
0/1	No goodness sake.. EXIT BREXIT.. IT'S the only option to avoid chaos and reduced living standards for everyone.
1/1	No it won't because we won't have to accept random unilateral EU directives written by unelected self-interested morons anymore.
1/1	No it won’t, no party will ever win a parliamentary majority with a pro EU agenda. We never liked the EEC, we don’t like the EU & were going to hate the United States of Europe when it comes about.
1/1	No longer have to bail out failing EU nations. Prop them up
0/0	No mate. The UK needs to learn to be less complacent the EU owes it nothing. It will find out what trading outside EU is like. TPP scotched Commonwealth also 4 countries line up to veto UK's membership in WTO. The UK has thrived at other countries expense. Colonies especially. The sharks are out and there's blood in the water.
1/1	No matter how much money George Soros pumps into the anti Brexit campaign, or how many tears are shed by the likes of Tony Bliar, There will not be a peoples vote. We've waited 40 years to get out of Europe. The remain campaign came out with so many lies, as did the unelected EU leaders. They laughed at Farage when he suggested the EU want a European Army. Now Macron has said in public, that he wants a European army.
0/1/1	No matter how much you whinge & chunter remainers your cause is very much lost. Now suck it up & accept reality, you will feel better I'm sure!
0/0	No matter the hardships or faceplants in the future, brexiteers will find other things to blame then brexit because admitting they were wrong would be admitting they are dumber then half the population.
0/0	No matter what happens, Boris and his like will not have to suffer any consequences. Their wealth and privilege insulate them from any damage they cause. They neither know nor care how anyone else will be affected.
0/-1	No money , no further contracts. If UK decides not to pay , what they have to pay, then EU will see this as an hostile act and will f...the UK. Then your planes will stay at the ground, all shipment s from europe and to europe get stuck , so finally you have no other choice then to pay your bills. And thats FAIR!
1/1	No more EU holding us back... RULE BRITANNIA!
1/1	No more bureaucracy
1/1	No more concessions to the EU. Let's take back control.
0/0	No more deal or no deal': Brexit language diktat for Foreign Office staff
0/1	No more drunken Brits abroad no more shagalufe no more zante no more garlic bread... we will just have to go down the local pub and have a pint.
1/1	No more money being paid into a European parliament that isn't even understandable by most (more money for investing and paying off the deficit and not going into an opaque government structure that likes to spend lots of taxpayers money on ???).
1/1	No more money from UK go to EU corrupted organisation ever again !!!!!!!bye
1/1	No more paying out billions to the EU for exceeding our financial targets
1/1	No more refugees!
1/1	No more remoaners, we are out get over it
1/1/1	No more stupid EU laws
1/1	No more time needed. Arrogant EU don't want to budge then we walk away on 29th March with our £39bn and use WTO rules.
0/0	No no, the EU will hardly notice Brexit....hmmm we’ll see!
1/1	No one gives a shit about Europe and this will be reflected in the turnout.
1/1	No one is losing access to the EU market, the young should have voted to leave if they ever want to own a house.
1/1	No one knows what it will be like when we leave Europe as it's never happened before. I'm a leaver. I'm against the EU anyway as it's nothing like what we actually agreed to sign up to back in the 70s. Personally I think we will be fine. There are many other countries around the world that are fairly strong economies that aren't members of a wider community such as the EU. It's getting these idiots that want to remain as part of the EU to see this. As with the current situation with our government, they are trying to get as much money as they can, as being part of EU, bags them a other wage, and a larger pension compared to if we wasn't in EU. As for EU itself, they don't want us to leave, as we are 1 of probably 4 or 5 countries that are wealthy enough to support the EU, as all the other countries are far weaker, and getting constant handouts from those 4 maybe 5 wealthy countries. If we leave, that pressure will be on 3 or 4 countries. Basically it's all about money. We will be far better off without the EU telling us what we can and can't do.
0/0	No one outside the DT echo chamber thinks Brexit will be a success.
1/1	No one said Brexit would be smooth but I believe it will be better in the long term.
0/0	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all.
0/0	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all. I vote to remain EU.
0/0	No plan, 27 vs 1, what a joke brexit is.
1/1	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU.
1/1	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU. And then all the others who leave can have the same agreement until there is no EU left and all nations are instead part of the new free trade block instead. There is ZERO need for a totalitarian and anti-democratic super state for the nations of Europe to have free trade with each other.
0/0	No pros. Any positive effect like temporary rise in wages will be short term, followed by closing of businesses.
1/1	No really. It wasn't economically viable for the UK to be robbed blind by (soon to collapse as everyone will leave) Europe.
1/1	No regrets we're out. Well done GREAT BRITAIN. The EU is a rip off money pit.
1/1	No regrets. I think the reaction proves that the elites were (and in many cases still are) taking the electorate for granted
1/1	No second thoughts here!!!!!!! Fantastic day for great Britain
1/-1	No self-promoting politician should be a reason for anyone to be stripped of their freedoms.
1/1	No shortage of anti Brexit fake news in the media. Every single day we have a new hysterical scare story. It is actually quite pathetic. If you want to talk about economic crash let's talk about unsustainable government debts? Oh no let's talk about house prices instead which the government does nothing but disort with their every idiotic intervention
1/-1	No should read how the EU lost Britain. As ever endless media bias and propaganda. Take a poll anywhere in Europe in the EU and explore the results: Greece, Germany, Hungary, Poland even France Holland and Denmark. STOP your Bias !!!!
0/0	No such thing as Getting Brexit done you twerp. Getting ready for mayhem when we crash out end of 2020 more like.
1/1/1	No the best way to fight the EU is leave it ,and watch it destroy itself when everyone else leaves.
1/1	No the problem is having a seat at the table the whole political class gets paid enormous sums of money there and its why most of UK political parties are pro EU so they can get a job there after their careers finish in the UK. Its a racket and not democratic.
0/0	No think tank is independent Most are funded directly from the government in ‘job inquiries’
0/0	No to Brexit. It’s a disaster for the UK.
1/1	No translation error with me: Good riddance to the EU! EU’s last words to UK before Brexit were ‘goodbye and good
0/0/0	No way am I ever going to fall in with Johnson's and Gove's demand to "come together" behind their Brexit project and move on into a glorious (isolationist or Atlanticist) future.
0/-1	No way, hon. I'm straight, white, a boomer, a Brexit supporter and voted Conservative. I'm the Devil.
1/1/1/1/1	No we not having second thoughts. We want out of the EUSSR
0/1	No we will not have what is termed Freedom of Movement in the EU. Learn what you are talking about.
0/0	No words express my sadness what happened to my beautiful Britain and its loving people, full of memories, friendships, living out a childhood fantasy. I am devastated, god bless you and us all.
0/0	No worries, you have Liam "trade deal with the EU should be the one of the easiest in human history" Fox on your side.
0/0	No worrys.....there will be no brexit. The signs are all over.
0/0	No, Britain is a strong European nation and we need everyone in the EU. There is power in unity!!!
1/1	No, Poland intervened because it wants its people back in order to continue to build its economy. It is quite happy for us to be out soon.
1/1	No, and EU should stop trying to stop democracy. EU is looking like tyranny
0/0	No, because I believe in the free movement of goods and services.
0/0	No, brexit is bad
0/0	No, but if we do still decide to leave and trade with it... Our exports would still have to follow EU regulations. On top of that we won't be able to influence those regulations and we may also have to pay tariffs on goods we export. Furthermore, those with any knowledge of economics will also be concerned about contracts. EU businesses are less likely to invest in a country outside 1. the Eurozone and 2. the EU itself. If we leave foreign investment will likely dry up.
0/-1	No, but the entire EU decides together if it wants to trade with you. If Germany wanted to trade with the UK, the EU would decide on it, would they let us have it easy? No.
0/-1	No, his head should be on a spike on the wall of the Tower of London with the rest of the brexiteer traiitors.
0/0	No, it might have proven a good idea if we had done it on the down low after preparing for about 20 years and retooling the whole economy for more independent trade but we just decided to do this like yesterday with no preparation and made a huge song and dance about it
0/0	No, it was an act of war on half the nation, land loss is that, always. We want to remain, we will remain. The referendum leave campaign was based on lies. Therefore you were not informed of the actual issues at stake. Therefore democracy was compromised. Therefore this PM should be in jail for subverting democracy, and the result annulled.
0/0	No, it's your mess, leavers. You don't get to pass the buck like that.
0/1	No, its not and you are foolish to believe that sum. I bet you believe Turkey is joining the EU soon and that the EU army is under way
0	No, not the English ,please BUT ,THE ARABS,THE TURKS ,THE INDIANS ,THE PAKISTANS ,THE ROMA-INDIANS ,THE AFRICANS and all of the Asians ,AFRICANS and other NOT-EUROPEANS should leave Europe and go back to dwell in their own homenland and their own continents
1/1	No, the EU is a complete mess right now and is only going to get worse... VOTE LEAVE!
1/1	No, the EU sucks. We need no deal and we will prosper because we're British. Tories are great. March 29th is bank holiday.
0/0	No, there are more risks leaving. Explain all the risks of staying.
0/0	No, they should stay inside the Union, it’s part of Europe
1/1	No, we left the EU so we can have an easier time to trade with countries outside the failing European Union. If you're going to speak about politics, please be informed about what you're commenting on.
0/0	No, we're absolutely Fucked.
0/0/0	No, we're absolutely Fucked. If we actually go through with 'Hard Brexit' (which is moderately likely at the moment) and there is no deal in March next year, you'll get to watch a pretty impressive political and economic experiment. The UK will become more detached from the global economy than almost everywhere except North Korea and Mauritania. It'll be brutal.
0/0/0	No-deal Brexit / WTO tariffs paid by importers of UK exports: Beef 84% Cheese 57% Wheat 53% Butter 48% Lamb 48% Pork 30% Potatoes 11.5% Fish 9.6% Current EU membership tariffs: Beef 0% Cheese 0% Wheat 0% Butter 0% Lamb 0% Pork 0% Potatoes 0% Fish 0% Spot the problem.
1/1	No-deal Brexit means you're no longer subservient to a govt of officials you didn't elect. It means taking back control of your own nation
0/0	No-one will notice anything different. It was all a complete waste of time and money.
1/1	No. And they won't have any say AT ALL in our legislation either.
1/1/0/1/1/1	No. I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
0	No. If it does it will be the biggest travesty of modern times in our country.
1/1	No. No. No. No... We voted LEAVE. MP's should do what the people of the United Kingdom told you to do and stop thinking of what they personally want. The people put you in office.. and we can take you out.
0/1	No. Now can people wise the fuck up and stop this insanity
1	No. The overriding sense is that, at long last, the British people are in charge. It's a horrible thought for the Guardian, I acknowledge.
0/0	Nobody can see what happens in the next 20 years but I say that the British people will regret their decision of leaving because they will have no voice over here anymore and are not part of important changes.
0/0	Nobody cares about all this. The EU was going to abolish the tampon tax anyway. What matters is the availability and cost of goods on the shop shelves. My guess is the costs will in general rise after Brexit.
0/0	Nobody denies that a hard brexit will cause a lot of suffering.
1/1	Nobody else would have the guts. Go on Theresa
1/-1	Nobody knows which way it's going to go, and nobody knows which way it will go. All we know is that whichever way it goes, it will mean THE END OF THE WORLD! Already, Barbara Windsor has committed suicide on EastEnders in anticipation of Brexit
0/0	Nobody really felt any of the actual effects of it, because we hadn’t yet had to look at border checks, we hadn’t had to consider what happens to our right to live, work, study and love in another country.”
0/1	Nobody sensible wants a no-deal Brexit yet that seems to be where we are heading. Does this make any sense to anyone?
0/0	Nobody tell the Brexiteers that we have 11 months of being absolute rule-takers with no say in said rules before they're able to fully celebrate their "victory"
0/1	Nobody under 40 voted Brexit they said. Everyone under 40 called them selfish old people for stealing their future they said. Well turns out the reality is quite different with nearly every single young person looking forwards to a bright future outside of the EU.
1/1	Nobody voted for a poxy deal. We vote to LEAVE THE EU, all of it, like we were told would happen.
0/0	Nobody voted for this. Brexit is turning into a national disaster. And 56% and growing now want to #Remain. Write to your MP to demand they #RevokeA50 and #StopBrexit.
1/1	Non EU immigrants support Brexit because they believe in democracy instead of totalitarianism which EU is sponsoring.
1/1	Non aggressive nationalism is a plus for most. Globalism is a quicksand swamp for 99% of individuals. The other 1% are cornering all riches.
1/1/1	Non skilled Europeans are already in their thousands in the UK. More have left the UK after grabbing a UK Social security number & are happily claiming child benefits, unemployment benefits & Incapacity allowance from UK taxpayers while living in EU. Leaches & parasites.
1/0	None of my Polish friends are going home.. many are taking out British citizenship Poland's loss Britain gain.
0/0	None of this drama would have been necessary if we had Remained. The Brexiters are drama queens. Anything for a bit of high theatre including especially the disruption of millions of people's ordinary lives. For nothing. Sovereignty my aunt Jemima!
0/-1	None of this is the EU's fault, IN FACT it will be easier for your government to do that now
0/0	Nonsense!! The British came all the way from Europe to west Africa and for the sole purpose of what they would gain from Nigeria, they amalgamated this useless country called Nigeria and since then we have never known peace and there is so much hate amongst the northern, southern and eastern people of this 'jungle' and now you want to break away from EU. Do you think you will know peace? I don't think so.
0/0	Noo stay i want to stay in eu
0/0	Noone mentions the value-loss of the pound in this after Brexit. It drains money out of the economy because speculative bussiness is using the turmoil to gain money by exchanging between currencies.
0/0	Noooo! Come back!
1/1	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2
1/1	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2.
1/1	Nope, not changed my mind. Brexit please...
0/1	Nope, the immigration had nothing to do with my vote. Immigrants that work and pay tax help our economy. I think now that we're not part of the EU, any EU citizens who live over here and have built a life for theirselves should just be given UK citizenship. It would be stupid to start kicking people out.
0/0	Nope. YOU voted to leave. I didn't.
0/1	North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago
0/0/1	Norton Motorcycles Brexiter Boss in 2018: "We are better prepared for brexit than the media would have you believe." Norton Motorcycles Brexiter Boss in March 2019: "Brexit has kicked us up the backside". January 29th 2020. Norton Motorcycles goes into administration. A classic British engineering company lost to this racism and tory tax dodgers greed.
0/0	Norway has oil and is OK on its own.  The Swiss look after everyone else's money --ill-gotten or not.   So far the EU is fairly content to remain together.   The Brits problem is and always has  been the fact that they want to rule rather than cooperate.   They just want to have an empire again.  Their economy is in shitty shape due to the austerity applied in 08 and they think they can go it alone?
1/1	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland are all not in the EU, all doing fine
1/1/1/1/1/1	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland...all not in the EU, all doing fine......
1/-1	Norwegian here, we have done fine without the EU (even though we are in schengen), the Britain will do fine too
0/0	Not EU's fault.
0/0	Not a British citizen, but I am living in Britain, and I am terrified of the prospect that the UK might vote to leave.
0/0	Not a good start, Boris
0/0	Not a single job lost Jeremy? Yesterday, another 900 jobs lost due to Brexit. And still, Corbyn refuses to lift a finger to stop this shambles.
0/0/0	Not a single reason for Brexit that makes any sense.
1/1	Not a surprise is it? We voted to Leave, and we are leaving all the EU systems and institutions.
1/1	Not about imagrants it's about a second government in Brussels dictating to us and making out it's democracy.
1/1	Not about the economy it's about our culture our way of life and is being destroyed we are becoming less British
0/0/0	Not all of us want to leave.
1/1	Not all people who voted out are old,young people voted out,so just get a move on And get us out.No more talk of a second referendum,17.4 mil voted out so do it,May grow a bloody back bone.
0/0	Not at all. Just cancel Brexit and be done with it. We'll all sleep easier knowing there will be food on the shelves.
0/0	Not being funny but a sandwich at my college normally cost £3 now it's going to be £5 bloody hell
1/1	Not complaining so much as EU stance proving exactly the point why they voted Leave.
1/-1	Not doing muc for the ‘proBrexit’ case and ‘bringing us all together’
0/0	Not even a hard brexit can cure a hardcore brexiteer.
1/1	Not even photoshop, i took a picture of my flag and it came out like this.happy brexit day
0	Not good this brexit....I can only see there being less monies in the United kingdom....in the not to distant future...bad idea if you ask me....Chris McMahon Inc .
1/1	Not happy with the transition period as it is. Any deal we make with another country has to be approved by the EU, not happy with that at all. Just leave, sure its a bumpy ride at first but we will be better off in the long run.
1/0	Not having a trade deal with the USA would our gain and their loss, any new president would not want to pass up on an opportunity to do business with the UK.
1/1	Not interested in any deal with Europe. Can't trust them. Or our own mps. Out no deal. Any body wants to be in Europe. move there. so true brits with backbone .Can run there own country. Like our grandfather's fought for.
1/1	Not just Europe! From Frau Merkel's latest speech she is evidently wanting world domination.
0/0	Not just economically. Britain is diminished in every way by Brexit. There are simply no benefits unless you are a rascist, a disaster capitalist or tax avoiding billionaire
0/0	Not just the car industry but the knock on effect on associated industries like 3D modelling and other IT industries will be catastrophic. And yet the Brexiteers said IT based service industries will grow exponentially post-Brexit
1/1	Not just the imagination its the lack of handling and now the terror attacks.. we dont want to be in tbe E.U #EliteUnion is what E.U means they want to control you more and more. Bring a civil war and see who defends them against the world.. All Races should United and Disable these Old men playing war games!
0/0	Not mentioned is environment. I fear for conservation funding and environmental legislation with Brexit.
1/1	Not my Parliament.HAPPY BREXIT DAY
1/1	Not one single person has any clue what remain means. Not one single person can say what would be the remain position.?
1/1/0	Not only England is happy with Brexit, Germany is too. Germany had never wanted Britain in the EU. Now At long last Germany scceeded in kicking Britain out of the EU.
1/1	Not only don't pay a penny, stop all benefit payments to all EU migrants working in the UK on 31 March as well. Watch the rats run: plenty of employment, housing and no NHS waiting lists from then on in...
0/0	Not only should it be delayed, it should be re-examined. What is worse, a step back from leaving the EU or a second referendum and cries of democracy having failed, or an economy that shrinks dramatically with all the dire consequences this will bring? I know which one I would prefer.
1/1	Not only the greatest moment in the history of Britain, could be the greatest moment in the history of the world as well
0/0	Not paying member fee has to have consequences (the EU is not the BBC). So - the deal the UK can get from the EU will be worse by that amount relative to what the UK had while a member.
1/1	Not quite right. Wealthy will receive zero impact to their level of life. It's middle class and poor who will get it worst. Middle class will loose standard of life, many of the poor will loose social support due to the poorer country's budgeting.
0/0	Not really surprising for May wanting to basically keep all benefits from the EU while ditching all obligations at the same point
0/0/0/0/-1	Not really surprising for May wanting to basically keep all benefits from the EU while ditching all obligations at the same point. Also not surprising that the EU won't buy it.
0/0	Not remotely possible for me to ever come together with you. Brexit has made me so miserable. You are responsible for a great amount of sadness, anger and confusion in this country.
1/-1	Not so much Johnson's glorious revolution as a glorious heist. Now Brexit is over the line, isn't it now time for oppositimistic
1/-1	Not surprised Britain voted to leave. They are 'too good' for EU and the rest of the world. Let's face it, deep down British people think they are the BEST country in the world and therefore think they are better than people from overseas. I've lived in the UK for 7 years as a foreigner and this is the vibe I get from all places I've lived in England and Wales.
0/0	Not the end of the world but almost
0/0	Not to late to cancel Brexit and remain in the EU
1/0	Not worried, just kind of disappointed. Been in Europe my whole life and never felt particularly oppressed, despite a few daily mail headlines. The whole thing just seems unnecessary.
0/0/0	Nothing about the referendum has made me quite as angry as Welsh people wanting to leave the EU.
1/1	Nothing about what’s happening in Italy in this paper, yet. How will Remainers spin the Euro dictatorship the rest of us can see?
0/0	Nothing but lies from the fascist right as usual.
0/0	Nothing good will come of Brexit, for the UK.
0/-1	Nothing happens. Only a fool would think anything will change tonight. It's just given the masses what they wanted - a brexit day. Behind it, it's all the same.
0/0	Nothing happy about this day whatsoever
1/1	Nothing more beautiful than a bunch of socialists crying the end of a failed project
1/0	Nothing more beautiful than a bunch of socialists crying the end of a failed project.... history repeats itself
0/1	Nothing quite says "Taking back control" like drawing up contigency plans for the evacuation of your head of state.
0/1	Nothing the EU has ever done validates this high handed, dictatorial approach.
1/1	Nothing the Nazi EU does surprises me the bastards that is why I voted to leave to get away from these leeches.
1/0	Nothing to celebrate if we have chosen Remain - everybody loses, one way or another. I feel people will regret their decision in five years!
0/0	Nothing to celebrate...only fear and regret.
1/1	Nothing will change ,Except we will thrive and stop paying into something that has whittled us away for 45 years .
0/0	Nothing will come from brexit, apart from job losses, its all bs
0/-1	Nothing will convince leavers to remain. Like nothing will convince a religious fanatic that his god is an invention of a human mind. So it's pointless. But fun.
0/0	Notice how people that voted to leave were all old and will probably die before it comes into effect.
1/1	Notice how the BBC didn't show Nigel's speech, they just showed him being scolded and then whatever that Irish woman was saying. He hasn't destroyed Europe as she said, what is she even talking about? Just spewing more EU crap. And that Nichola Sturgeon is a trouble maker, just like Corbyn.
1/1	Notice how these rich people never get poorer but keep telling you it's brexits fault. Nothing to do with millions of unskilled from the eu coming here and getting housing benefit tax credits and public services having paid minimal tax.
1/1	Notice nobody laughs at Farage as much anymore?
1/-1	Notice the way the crowd was turned down in the mix on the opening sequence and in the national anthem art . They still can’t let go .
1/1/0	Now : yeah   1 year later : nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
0/0	Now Boris Johnson is PM... Oh Boy
0/0	Now Brexiteers are going to keep bombarding the public with propositions that are not possible to keep up the blame on the EU for not being able to accept, always framing it as the EU being unreasonable towards unicorns.
0/0	Now Britons will need visa to get into the European countries, as an aftermath.
1/1	Now I wished Scotland left, they be happier and be safer at this point
0/1	Now Scotland to leave the UK this time! and for a border pole in the north of Ireland for reunification with Republic of Ireland
0/0	Now UK can trade freely... YEAH!!!! Then you forget that WTO trade tariff is based on what the country individually prefer and you need to obey them in order to reach an agreement since you're no longer can use EU tariff anymore... LOL. I think UK make a big mistake prefering Brexit seriously.
0/0	Now UK has no one else to blame :-)
0/0	Now asking UK companies to beg the EU for mercy. That Brexit's going great, eh?
0/1	Now at the mercy of the Tories.....god help us all..
1/1	Now begins the struggle to return sovereignty to the UK. There are plenty in the establishment that will try to undermine the victory of democracy.
1/-1	Now boris stop partying about brexit get these wild dogs put to sleep bring back the noose
0/1	Now bring back normality and stop torturing us with this Tory infighting brexit scam and Revoke Article 50. Business confidence and stability will return The easiest option is staring them in the face and these Ministers keep on dithering, good to see they are now 'Raising their game' as The Speaker instructed them weeks ago. Brexit is quite plainly not a desirable option in any format. There is no majority for any of it. We don't want to be hearing daily brexit for years to come. Exit Brexit.
0/0/1	Now charity begin at home
0/0	Now get ready for the consequences. France former president DeGaule was right to oppose UK adherence to European Union.
1/1	Now i can sleep easy because i know all of this is really going to help me out somehow
0/1	Now it's not about Brexit , the damage of division among society is far bigger than any Brexit.
1/1	Now its our time, our land, our choice, Brussels rules gone forever.
0/0	Now it’s not the time to campaign to rejoin. But we must keep dream alive, especially for young people who are pro-Europe. I hold in my heart the knowledge that I'll be back in this chamber celebrating our return to 💚 of Europe.
1/1	Now it’s time to bring back manufacturing to Great Britain, instead of outsourcing to the EU.
1/1	Now just work hard and hard enough to prove that brexit is only the right option!!!!
1/1	Now leaders can Make Britain Great Again without the EU sucking Britons dry, flooding their cities with terrorists masquerading as refugees.
1/1	Now let's get a good deal, UK an Island, a trade agreement with EU, make our own rules
1/1/1	Now let’s use this opportunity to integrate with the wider world in trade and cooperation... and NOT use it as a Tory wet dream to rouse nationalistic-imperialist sentiment in the minds of the populac
1	Now let’s use this opportunity to integrate with the wider world in trade and cooperation... and NOT use it as a Tory wet dream to rouse nationalistic-imperialist sentiment in the minds of the populace
1/1	Now our economy will no longer be dragged down by Greece's
0/0	Now please let us leave the UK we dont wanna be there we didn't wanna leave the EU and we want our lands back and a future for out children 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
0/0	Now seeing this. i see how many stupid people the UK haves. dont know anything and there are only old people talking. bye UK good luck you will lose a lot
1/0/0	Now stand with Scotland and Irland.
1/1	Now that Brexit has happened and is reality it's time to realise that it's up to everybody to make success of it. Why do you expect leavers to do all the work while you sit and be a dead weight yourself? Brexiteers did not say for 47 years "well, remainers, it's all up to you, we remain so you prove us it is worth it" so why would you?
1/1	Now that Trump is going to be the president, I believe that Brexit will end up being totally justified, because a US/UK trade deal is going to be "bigly". The UK, being able to negotiate with the U.S. on equal footing, and without the myriad of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels creating massive roadblocks and regulation, will end up being a economic boon for both countries.
1/1/-1	Now that brexit is out the way. Let’s finally get round to legalising weed
1/0	Now that can be the colony of it's past colony.
0/0	Now that opinion polls have shifted massively in favour of REMAIN, BREXIT must be halted in its entirety by all means necessary!
0/0	Now that the Polish workers are being barred, are you Brits ready to take their job as plumber or clean building windows?
0/0	Now that the “Brexiteers / Leavers” have “won” they are very angry. As things get progressively worse in the U.K. they will get angrier. There is no good reason to Brexit.
1/1/1/1	Now the UK won't be a Muslim state, good job!
0/1	Now they can only blame themselves and no longer EU
0/-1	Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning
1/1	Now we have chance to engage with the modern world, unfettered by the EU's silly tarrifs and mass of regulations - mostly in place due to systemic corruption at Brussels.
0	Now we just sit back and wait before UK realises they cannot cope alone and on their own and will try to return to cooperation with Europe in one form or another
1/-1	Now we need Swexit! Let the corrupt EU fall apart and let the eurocrats seek work elsewhere, they can wash dishes or clean toilets for what I care.
1/1	Now we need someone to lead a movement to end mass immigration.
0/0/-1	Now we're bobbing in the ocean alone with countless of Great White sharks circuling us. Get ready for the greatest ever fire sale.
0/1/0	Now you have finished UK
0/1	Now you will see in horrific detail how much the EU needed Britain. The backpedaling and grovelling from the politicians in Brussels will shocking to most of you.
0/0	Now, I am still not fully up for Britain leaving the European Union - there are still a huge amount of advantages of staying in.
0/0	Now, more than ever is not the time to withdraw from our neighbours. The consequences, particularly for those least able to withstand them will be undoubtedly negative. Don't let the likes of Johnson, Gove and the vile Farage persuade you otherwise. Our membership of the EU is something to be proud of, we can't turn the clock back and the future of the UK is far better served by remaining in. Voting leave will undoubtedly unleash forces and attitudes that have no place in a civilised society, one of the prime reasons for the formation of the EU in the first place.
0/0	OMG this is hilarious. The UK will have no choice but to pay. You made your bed now lie in it.
0/0	OMG! We (the UK) are so f**ked now....
0/1	ONE WORD "BYE"
1/1	ONE of Britain's foremost pensions experts has warned that remaining in the EU will be catastrophic for both state and private pensions in the UK. Why are the remainiacs not putting this little gem out to the voting public. vote leave.
1/1	ONLY Jacob understands politics. He's the only brain here AND he cares about PEOPLE way more than the Left do.
1/1	OOOOOOOOOOO!!! WE DID IT!!! BREXIT ALL THE WAY!!! WOOOOOOOOOO!!!...
0	OR YOU COULD, YOU KNOW, JUST NOT BREXIT. THAT'S AN OPTION, TOO.
1/1	OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT FOR SALE! Why can't the bremainers understand this? It's bad enough that Westminster is out of touch with the people, the eurocrats at Brussels would be even more so and we won't be able to remove them from power! So there really is only one sensible choice in this referendum and that's to leave!
1/1	OUR government CAN NOT CONTROL ANYTHING as we are CONTROLED FROM THE EU on all matters ,if and a big if we stay in ,within the next 20-30 years THE EU will have abolished ALL governments of all member states THEY ARE HELL BENT ON FULL CONTROL of everyone within the EU ,that wont worry me one bit as i will be dead,but for the last few years of my life ,i would really like for the UK TO BE FREE FROM their CONTROL VOTE ALONG WITH ME and VOTE OUT

1/1	OUT ,i find it an insult to be part of europe ,i am BRITISH NOT EUROPEAN
1/1	OUT IS OUT.....WHATS THE PROBLEM.. YES WE VOTED OUT
1/1	OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT... BUT THE NWO IS IN FULL EFFECT, SCARE MONGERING AND EVERYTHING.
1/1	OUT OUT OUT! We must protect our country, culture and identity. Think about the British people of the future.
1/1	OUT OUT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/1	OUT, OUT, OUT. And of course leave the EU as well!!!
1/1/1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists
1/1/1/1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
0/0	OWNED BY CHINA!!!! BWUUUUAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Good luck Oliver Twist!
0/0	Obama is a very wise man & I'd certainly follow his advice to vote to REMAIN IN the EU. Most of the politicians who want to leave are proven two faced liars.
1/1	Obama should keep his nose out of our affairs. His arrogance is breathtaking. Seeing our leader grinning like an idiot while he threatened us made me, for the first time in my life, feel ashamed to be British. Vote Leave to regain our self respect!
1/1	Obvious remain propaganda is obvious remain propaganda.
0/-1	Obviously 'flying' with the Michael Gove has sparked anger after claiming the UK doesn’t “need” a post-Brexit trade
1/0	Obviously no loss as she doesn’t realise that she never left Europe in the first place. The UK is set to leave the EU not Europe which it will always be part of. Cheerio then.
1/0	Obviously sent on date of us leaving the EU out of sheer spite and pettiness and seems very childish to me. There is nothing more to say.
0/0	Obviously the British people did not vote for what's happening now. They were given a ton load of misleading information and the Russians got in the muddle. Why is no one talking about a new vote? Seems to be their only way to get out of this.
0/0	Obviously though we are all sad to lose our British friends. Increasingly though it seems that while we want the UK that was to stay we are uncertain about the UK that is. Tbh this seems more an internal reckoning that got out of hand than something to do with the EU
0/0	Of all bad ideas ‘Great Britain’ has had, leaving the EU is the biggest, by far!
0/0/0	Of all the be careful what you wish for examples, "Brexit" is right there at the top of the list. Ok, maybe second, after "President Trump".
0/1	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe.
0/-1	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe. But Brexit means also that something was wrong in Britain
0/0	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe. But Brexit means also that something was wrong in Britain.
1/1	Of course Tusk is calling for Brexit to be cancelled. He still wants our money and as the EU have proven time and again they have no concern for what people actually want as long as the cash keeps rolling in
0/0/0	Of course brexit will be a success...for its wealthy hedge fund backers.
1/1	Of course the EU want to keep the U.K. in the Customs Union, they still want our money. When will our Government wake up and just walk. We could have saved 2 years waste of effort.
1	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.
1/1	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.they have done very well for their directors and shareholders.ordinary workers have seen their wages stagnate while the cost of living has skyrocketed.it is no good politicians quoting statistics and percentages we want to see a true rise in ordinary people's standard of living.
1	Of course they are protesting. Millions of foreigners are living and working in Uk freely because of E.U. treated. Once Brexit goes through, Millions of those people will have to go back to their country of origin
1/1	Of course we should the EU is more corrupt than FIFA.The EU after 20 years have still not had their accounts signed off.
0/0	Of course we want you to stay! Brexit is a tragedy for Europe as a whole. Please stay!
0/0	Of course we won`t starve but I bet that in less than 40 years time we will want to rejoin the EU.
1/1	Of course, Germany companies have been moving their factories out of the EU for Years to non EU countries to avoid the high German taxes and EU meddling in their regulatory affairs. We MUST remove UK Plc from the influence of the EU to safeguard our interests tpp.
1/0	Off and go! Never come back as we do not need you
1/-1	Off sick today. I can watch Andrew Neil talking to Polly Toynbee or flip over to Jeremy Kyle. Tough choice. We are here because of the arogance of people who thought that they were better and cleverer than the people they were meant to represent.
1/1	Off we go, and no remoaners - I don't mean your imaginary cliff.
0	Officially #Brexit day. And nothing, nothing is securely planned for our future, but 130bn has been spent. Unbelievable.
0/0	Officially the end of UK at 11pm, nothing much really to celebrate about
0/0	Oh I can't wait for all those lovely trade deals. Of course, we are in such a strong position to negotiate
1/-1	Oh What a Traitor...Lets see if we hear tonight before the Polls open @ 7am. For More Contact Leave
1/1	Oh another piece of Hollywood corporations telling us feeble minded people that we were tricked and or duped into doing something we don't want to! How will I ever know anything if not for these Hollywood corporations, thanks for looking after me.
0/0	Oh boy, I cannot wait until we’re back in the EU after 20 years
0/0	Oh boy. This comment section shows why it's a gift for the EU that the UK leaves it. They have never understood the idea of a united Europe. They don't want to be equal, they want to be special
0/0/0	Oh dear - in less than 11 months, you will be definitely losing access to 168 trade agreements and over 40 free trade deals, regardless of what happens with the EU - UK trade agreement. Even if you get it, you can wave goodbye to the above. There are over 6000 different agreements that exist between the EU and other countries governing flights, auto/insurance and driving license acceptances, medicine and so on. Good luck trying to replicate this before the country crumbles. Enjoy the moment Brexiters, it won’t last long - and don’t forget: you will be reminded every step of the way that it is YOUR responsibility.
1/1	Oh dear EU it seems companies are more likely to desert the EU than Britain.
0/-1	Oh dear me, I have found another one of those leftist internet shitholes again
1/1	Oh dear. More anti Brexit propaganda. Did the EU pay for this? It’s clearly telling the audience that the only reason Britain voted to leave was because of an evil mastermind tricking people into doing so.
1/1	Oh dear. The EU have just lost a country with the equivalent of 18 of their economies.
1/1	Oh do give it a rest ! Just pack up and sod off to live on mainland Europe if you think the EU is so bloody great.
0/0	Oh don't fucking start. You got your bollocks Brexit. Enjoy it while you can before you start whingeing about Scexit
1/0	Oh f#$k off with the race card ! I'm married to a Chinese ( beautiful ) lady with gorgeous half cast children ! And we support farage and also voted leave ! So stick your labels( ie racist ect )up your arse !!!
0/0	Oh for god’s sake: if Deutsche is Lehman, then the U.K. will have issues just like it did after, yes, Lehman, a company based in the USA, not the EU!!! So it’s got nothing to do with the EU! And “demographic problem thanks to feminism”?!? I can see where leavers want to take women, back to the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant!
0/0	Oh for goodness sake. As if Nigel Garage (as I like to call him) hasn’t humiliated us enough.
0/0	Oh goody. Another day facing the consequences of the result of a vote on the all-too-real future having been dictated by nostalgia for a non-existent past.
0/1/1	Oh how very kind of them, that's lovely, they're so nice after we've messed up so badly by deciding to leave, such gracious masters.
0/0	Oh it's all going so well! Brexiteers still won't accept any responsibility for this shit storm we are in.
1/1	Oh joy of joys were out of that undemocratic fascist deceiving organization known as the eu
0/0	Oh look no one answered that question, typical Brexiters
1/-1	Oh look.... propaganda!
0/0	Oh lord, Brexit is the biggest political shitshow in history
0/1	Oh my God everything is just the same as it was it's a miracle lol
0/0	Oh my god, what a shame, Brexit won, the world is coming to an end.
1/1	Oh she meant it all right. We mean it too, the only difference between us is that it is the EU who will need "luck".
1/-1	Oh so nobody is allowed to vote against popular opinion then its cooked or cheated?
1/1	Oh the euphoria.
0/0	Oh the irony, pensioners deciding the future of the millennials.
1/1	Oh this looks unbiased and fair.... People voted leave overwhelmingly because the EU have no sovereign democratic right to make law over UK citizens
0/0	Oh well more Brexiter lies.
0/0	Oh well more terrorist attacks to come, Lord Rothchild Jacob can't be to happy aye
0/0	Oh well, being a first world country was good while it lasted.Hopefully the ghost of Charles de Gaulle will let us back in in a few months when everything sucks again.
1/0	Oh well, guess you'll be building those houses yourselves now.
0	Oh well. Once Brexit is done, every briton will become a millionaire. Isn't that right, Mr Farage?
0/0	Oh yeah, just what the UK needs, US-style health insurance with its high rates.
1/1	Oh yeah. Simply because you don't like the outcome of a referendum, don't do the will of the people. Do a terrible job negotiating and the throw your hands up and have do over. I wonder how many pushing this decidedly anti-democratic path would feel the same if the remainers had won??
1/0	Oh yes i do. You have cried like children since the result. I wouldn't want to share a trench with any of you t its. Don't like it then feel free to move to "Europe". Idiot.
0/0	Oh yes? We're coming to get you. You have NO conception of what you've unleashed.
1/1	Oh! Dear! One less "Project Fear" Remainers can't use. Do you really expect very much to change after Brexit? Do you really expect things to change much even after a hard Brexit? They need us. We don't need them.
0/0	Oh, like you know him. It’s Buik not Buick. Typical leaver, never gets his facts straight and pretends to know more than he does while accusing everyone else who disagrees with him of manufacturing lies.
0/-1	Ohh the poor England with no money had to leave the eu
0/0	Ok great i can't wait when Ireland an Scotland will make a divorce and split from UK
1/1	Ok remainders, it’s you we are sick of listening too, you moan moan moan, democracy no longer seems to work In this country, pathetic liberals constantly crying because a democratic vote did not go there way.
1/1	Ok so having control of our fishing etc in our waters. Why should our fishing communities be told they are at quota levels but other Eu nations can fish. Surely our priority is to feed our own.
1/1/1	Ok, got Brexit done. Soon we take back control!
0/0	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think #Brexit is rubbish.
0/0	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think brexit is rubbish. Sorry.
1/1	Ok, lets debunk the fear lies; moving goods from or to the UK wont be a huge issue, not to buyers and sellers with a brain, companies are not going to want to shoot themselves in the foot to punish Britain, they still want to sell their good stuff and their rubbish to UK customers and still want to trade with good UK traders, like they do with other countries outside of the EU.Britain will make deals with other markets which will now be easier and cheaper.Britain and the EU have just over two years to sort it out, the changes are not happening next week.If people loose jobs or the mortgage goes up, that's a result of the lies of fear the Remain camp and the media were spreading; see the world didn't end.The UK was never really protected in any way by the EU, if Russia invaded the EU would do nothing, we are protected by Nato, which has nothing to do with the EU.Laws can be made or changed to ease the changes, if the ones in charge care to do so.SO STOP PANICING AND SPREADING LIES OF FEAR.
0/0	Ok, so we need to destroy the country to get rid of UKIP. I would prefer giving them dozens of seats at Westminster, they are useless anyway
1/1	Ok. Perfect. Now LEAVE! Europe had enough of your theatrical attitude. Good bye!
0/0	Okay I'm not even British but just the thought of something like that happening to a country terrifies me. Yes it had it's pros but the cons outweigh it. At least from what I've seen and heard. Please correct me if I'm wrong because I am no expert but still, doesn't seem like the best idea.
0/0	Old people and idiots have screwed the uk.
0/0	Old people have taken away our right to live and work freely in the EU because they felt a bit patriotic. I don't recall millennial doing anything like that.
0/0	Old people voted to leave. Young people voted to stay. Who's future is it though...
0/0	Old stubborn UK people destroying the future for their next generations.
0/0	Old, uneducated and unemployed are for brexit
1/1	Omg how exciting. Britain taking back its country. An historical moment and I'm excited to be part of it. X
1/1	On 25th May 1961 President Kennedy said they would enter a programme to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. It took just 8 years with the limited technology available at that time. Obama talks about a trade deal with the UK taking more than that time, absolute piffle . What this means is that the US are now so sluggish that other nations will overtake them as the worlds powerful economic nation, if not already, eg China, India and perhaps one day the UK. Vote leave on 23rd June.
1/1	On 31th of January, at 11pm, after 30 years of resistance, the great people of Britain had finally got Brexit done ! Our proud nation finally left the eussr ’superstate’...
1/1	On farmers. Since the UK is not self sufficient then it follows that farmers will have an excellent market. Carbon footprints would be reduced to.
1/1	On the ballot paper there should only be leave options.  The country has already voted to leave.
0/0	On the basis of all the evidence, I’d say Brexit isn’t working.
0/0	On the contrary, poll after poll shows the people who voted to leave now regret their decision
0/0	On the other hand they are stating that the only reason for remaining is "economic risks"... They are not considering political and military fields, or simply the freedom to move to any European country at any time. I wouldn't say that it isn't neutral, it is just very simplified
0/0/0	On the other hand, the Leave camp claim that energy bills will go down on Brexit - but that can only happen if the UK scraps its own rigorous Climate Change Act, which the government says it won't do.
0/0	On the two-year anniversary of the EU referendum, tens of thousands people took to the streets of London, UK, on Saturday to protest Brexit, demanding that the public have a say on the final Brexit deal.
1/1	On the whole we Brits love Europe we just don’t like the EU or teh way we have been boiled like a frog to invoke the long term ‘hidden’ plan and undemocratic process to morph the common market into the United States of Europe.
1/-1	On your way out, can I invite you to peek at my book, "Slaying Brexit Unicorns"? It busts two dozen Brexit myths
1/1	Once again the liberals refuse to obey the will of the people.
1/-1	Once again the weak Labour candidates come out of the woodwork to argue for freedom of movement once we leave. Kier Starmer uses the 'old' NHS bone, as do all the remoaners. From memory, 6% of all NHS staff are from the EU. Which means Mr Starmer 94% are NOT from the EU! So stop making everyone believe the entire NHS is run by the bloody european union ffs, idiot.
0/0	Once again, people are blaming the EU for the behaviour of greedy bankers. Let's not mix everything up, please! This old ongoing Germanophobia popular in England is really pathetic. Instead of doing well, some in England prefer to blame others for their misfortune. Start by throwing out all those third world migrants for a start (no, that's not the EU's fault, it's political correctness that is at fault). So, once again, the EU is not the problem, the greedy corporations are the problem.
0/1/0	Once again: Out means out! No third-country will ever have the same advantages as an EU member has. Decisions have consequences.
0/1	Once it's done Boris, let's give Sturgeon a good kick in baws. Good man, carry on.
0/0	Once the welfare state is dismantled then no more sponging foreigners will come in, that totally makes starving in a ditch unable to afford basic healthcare totally worth it right?
0/0	Once their economy collapses. I look forward to buying cheap british property
0/0	Once their money is safe in unregulated tax havens they will never give another toss what happens to the country and/or anyone in it except them.
1/1	Once they see how Much more successful the UK is outside - they will be lining up to leave. The EU know it
1/1	Once we have left, we can stay as close to the EU as is convenient to us. Not how convenient it is for the EU.
1/1	Once we’ve left the EU, we will be sovereign and free (whatever that means). Our skilled negotiators (led by dead-beats such as Liz Truss) will strike a free-trade deal with Japan, something the Brussels bureaucrats could never pull off.
1/0	One EU to rule them all, one EU to find them, One EU to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
0/0	One benefit of brexit is that lots of manufacturing workers are going to have a LOT more freetime. Around 100% more.....
0/-1	One couple didn’t bother voting at all because they never went abroad for their holidays so it was irrelevant to them whether the UK stayed in the EU or not.
1/0/0	One day people will learn, no one wants open bidders but politicians who profit off the poor and criminals. Multi cultural is destructive. Multi ethnic is fine but multiculturalism is a crime against humanity. If you don't believe in the culture, don't go there. If you believe you're a Mexican then stay in Mexico. If you believe you are an African then by all means, move to Africa. You are what your culture says you are. You're either British and you believe in the British culture or you aren't and therefore you should gtfo. You are either American or you aren't, gtfo. You don't go to a Muslim cultural nation and debased to build a Catholic church so don't come to our nation and debased to build a mosque. #BREXIT!!! Get your own house in order before you start worrying about housing flunkies who'd just as soon cut your throat ads rape your children as to look at you.
0/1	One day they'll write in the history books about how the Tories led the UK to vote away their workers rights, environmental protections and to privatise the very health service that has helped every one of us and was once a great example to the rest of the world for how to run a health service for the people.
0/0	One hundred years from now in history lessons the definition of Brexit will be summarised by “no one knew fuck all at any point “
1/1	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies
1/1	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies.
1/1	One mans reason for voting leave was because he couldn't make money killing Moles. Strychnine is an alkaloid poison. ... Strychnine has been described as dangerous and inhumane and was banned for wildlife management under the Animals (Cruel poisons) Regulations of 1963, and yet its continued use was allowed only with moles. (English legislation). This legislation was taken to Europe by the UK and ratified into EU Law but they decided that the poison had no part in a modern world when there were more humane ways of killing Animals identified as pests
1/-1	One more thing we share with our British friends - a good sense of humour.
0/0/0	One nation conservatisme is morphing more and more towards ein Volk, ein Führer. When will the first statues of Enoch Powell and Oswald Mosley be erected?
1/1	One of our greatest contributions has been our long history of democratic government. In rejecting the undemocratic centralising power of the EU the UK is once again a standard bearer for democracy. The EU is heading in the wrong direction, it is destroying generations of young people in Greece, France, Italy and Spain through mass unemployment and it is entirely resistant to any reform via the ballot box. We have no choice but to leave it we want to protect the right to elect those who rule us.
0/0	One of the basic cornerstones of the European Union is its free market. That means free movement of capital as well as people. The UK would like to have the first but not the second. The UK wants to reap all the rewards but not pay any dues. Does that remind you of anything? One word: NAFTA!
1/-1	One of the basic freedoms is for people to be able to vote and decide on their own future. When the spokespeople support mass violence against peaceful voters, your institution becomes something quite sinister.
1/1/1	One of the best days of my life when those results came in.
0/0	One of the biggest political shit shows in recent history
0/0	One of the dumbest moves by the UK since Chamberland signed a deal with Hitler.
0/0	One of the good things about Brexit is that I feel more European than ever! Under 30% of the population voted to chain the younger and educated to their flawed political, conservative, defensive, post-colonial ideology based on feeling and emotion rather than economic sense. 73% of 30 year olds and younger are pro remain. Leave a light on Europe, we'll be back!
1/1	One of the greatest days in our proud history on behalf of the nation a big thank to Boris and his cabinet , special thank you to Nigel Farage he deserves a knighthood lets make Britain great again, time to clean up our country, bring back national service and bring back the death penalty. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
1/1	One of the happiest days in my life
1/1	One of the reasons we left was because of their rules .. just give them finger and tell them no deal. We will survive .
0/0	One of the result of ego, this will reflect it's downside in UK soon.
1	One of the saddest day in the UK .
0/0	One of the things I agree with Brexiteers about is it’s not all about money.For me it’s also about shared culture,shared experience and international understanding.I also think it’s about commitment to reform aspects of the EU that need it. You can’t do that from the outside.
0/0	One of the worst and saddest nights in British politics. Such a catastrophic decision, I don't understand why Cameron let this fringe-issue that no one cared about until the start of 2016 go to the public after the AV referendum.
0/0	One of those responsible for this Brexit mess, he continues to demonstrate he did not understand international trade when advocating leaving the EU.
0/-1	One opportunity for Britain to leave on a professional and responsible note and it was tossed away for someone's inflated ego and for him to remain relevant. Absolutely disgraceful and highlights the less 'graceful' elements of the tragedy that is Brexit.
1/1	One plus of Brexit is that Farage no longer has the European Parliament as a platform and source of funds, which he used to great effect for 20 years. The great irony of UKIP & the Brexit party is that they were funded and promoted by the EU itself. This will now stop
0/-1/0	One potential consequence of Brexit is that Scotland could leave the U.K. This would end a 313-year-old union
1/0	One thing I did like about the EU was the check on the bastard faction of the Tories fucking us over too quickly. Ah well.
0/0	One thing I miss here is that xou didn‘t look into what the membership fees did FOR the UK economy.
1	One thing is for sure we couldn't go on with the uncertainty of the last 3 years.At least we can move forward now.
0/1	One thing you can be sure of: had the result been 52/48 the other way, leavers would be demanding a second referendum, saying demographics had shifted n the favour (and the usual nonsense about "unelected dictators")
0/0	One week until the people of #Britain could really f**k things up for generations to come #VoteStay
1/1	One word describes the EU now: decline. Declining share of world trade, declining size and GDP, declining world influence, declining repute and standing, declining integrity.....entropy dear Rem-chums, entropy.
1/1	One year to go! It can’t come fast enough.
0/0	One year until the UK crashes and burns.
0/0	Only 26% of the population voted to leave
0/0	Only 47% of the voting population voted to leave in the Advisory referendum. Not the will of the people. Now we will uncover the lies of the Leave Campaign. God help our United Kingdom
1/1	Only Germany and Netherlands seem to be doing well in the EU at the moment.
1/1	Only Germany matters, all the others are coat tail hangers.
0/1/0	Only a insecure country feels tiny by an economic trade union
0/0	Only a minority of the population (17 million) voted for brexitIt is entirely right that the other 50 million will hold this minority of mainly Brexiteer pensioners responsible for everything that happens from this point forward
1/0	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo
0/0	Only a smidge in our economy. £10 bn is 7% of how much the goverment put into the nhs each year. Not much at all, and we get billions back in science investments, infrastructure investments and ofcourse a single market.
1/1	Only corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !!
1/0	Only countries that are prepared to grovel and do as they're told are welcome in the EU. Perfect for Krankie.
1/1	Only good deal is a NO DEAL, please just leave, talk or not when we are 100 % out.
0/0	Only idiots want to leave. Unity has proven more efficient than divided
1/1	Only lies I remember have come from the EU and the biases bbc and remainers trying too scaremonger us to change our minds telling us we didn't know what we voted for well guess what we did and we still stand by our vote freedom is what we wanted and freedom is what we expect WTO no EU alignment no EU rules
1/1	Only one chance in a lifetime to free ourselves from the shackles of the cesspit EU, please have the courage to vote LEAVE on Thursday!
0/1	Only pussies run away when they face problems - better solve them."sorry thought you were talking about all the Eastern Europeans who have fled their nations and under cut the British working class.
0/0	Only the British could tyrannically invade and colonise half the world, then leave the EU due to immigration.
0/0	Only the Brits do not realise that they are a living joke
1/1	Only thing the british Government have done here is show how weak they really are to the EU who will now laugh in May’s face.. This is a disgrace just leave
1/1/1	Only took 4 years coz of snivelling remainers obstructing democracy
0/-1	Only took like 4 years tho.
1/1	Only two more days and we regain our independence.
1/1/1	Only two more days and we regain our independence. Brilliant!!!
1/1	Onwards and upward. Remain is finished. Let’s make Britain Great again.
1/1	Onwards my british friends, fight for your country and your liberty!
0/1	Ooh I don't understand these things but I don't like foreigners. Literally just heard this from a leave voter.
0/0	Oooh controversial! I’m not a fan of brexit, I feel that the original referendum came at a time when the public were very disenfranchised with the political system and the outcome din’t necessarily reflect the true beliefs of the country but more the want for change in the system. Plus the referendum has so many issues with the campaigns on both sides and whether it was binding. What really annoys me though is that research in universities has already been really affected by this and all the unknowns that go with it. With all the things we might struggle with after the big day, it seems very short sighted to do this without a good plan or something that resembles a deal
1/1	Open borders, bureaucratic, dictatorial government. The EU is going to fail, and I will enjoy it
0/0	Opening sentence: “A multi-millionaire Brexit Party candidate has invented a bin for homeless people to sleep in.”
1/1	Opinion polls are consistenly showing that the result would be reversed if the referendum were held again. Hahaha in fact your "polls" were all pointing that Brexit would win! LOL
0/1	Opportunities you say @BorisJohnson? That's awesome. Tell me more about these opportunities?
1/0	Opposing Brexit now. Propping up the man that took the nation over the cliff then. You've really joined a party that people can believe in
0	Or they know how fruitless going against the establishment is. The UK is not free. things are probably going to get really bad for the UK soon. The elite will not let the UK go this easy. The EU controls Europe. The UK made a big mistake.
0/1	Or vote for candidate that is anti-brexit and will follow through on their beliefs.
0/0	Ordinary UK persons don't even understand the implications of this thing called Brexit. And why would they. Politics are sold in hyperboles and mindlessness in bulk. In fact I doubt even the so called MPs understand the nuances and nth degree ramifications with probability distribution attached.
0/1	Oswald Mosley had 50,000 followers in Britain that wanted to welcome Hitler into country , now we have remainers who done believe we can run our own country ,Even Churchill was initially voted down when he wanted to re arm our country against German aggression. The modern day quisling remainers will have as slaves to the EU. forever , freedom now.
1/1	Other EU countries sell more to us than we sell to them, so if we do leave and they decide to have a strop and refuse to negotiate new deals with us then it will be their loss, not ours.
1/1	Other Eu states will follow when we make a success of it.
1/1	Other countries are excited about trading with the UK and taking away the EU maket for goods in the UK
1/1	Other countries manage to function without membership of EU. And there’s a whole world to trade with out there.
1	Other countries should follow,EU Exit Union be your own country again.
1/1	Other countries still want to trade with us so tell the EU no deal,they need us more than we need them we don't need them and we certainly don't want all,the millions of eu foreigners here
1/-1	Other pro-Brexit campaigners would not necessarily reduce immigration, but agreed that it should be up to the British Government to set the rules
1/1/1	Other than that the EU is quite flawed
1/1	Our Brexit destiny in the 21st Century is a watershed philosophical choice, far beyond immediate trade
0/0	Our FPTP allows an `elective dictorship’.. It would have been exactly the same if Corbyn and his acolytes were in power.. We have a principle free, serial liar in charge, supported by his enablers in the media who will parrot whatever shite he comes out with next
0/0	Our Home, Our Friends, Our Neighbours, Our Family, The EU is OUR HOME! Keep Our Star 🌟 Safe, We will RETURN HOME and One Day Soon! When this country Wakes Up and Realises what it's Done and the Stupidity of Brexit, Listened to the LIES AND PROPAGANDA of Facists, Liars and Criminals funded by CROOKS!
1/1	Our country disappeared, but now we can have it back!
0/0	Our economy is doomed when we leave, less doomed but still fucked with Mays deal, and UTTERLY doomed if we leave with no deal at all.
1/1	Our economy will be stronger outside the EU - we will have the power to strike trade deals, creating 300,000 new jobs. #bbcqt #VoteLeave
0/0	Our future our choice... Never give up! Brexit is a shit
0/0	Our great leader, the inveterate lier, adulterer, philanderer, Johnson is going to lead the country to greatness...what a hope, more like leading us into complete disaster.
0/0	Our influence in the world would be much diminished if we leave. Brexiters are thinking with their emotions, they do not know what would happen. For all they know it would destroy us.
0/-1/0	Our leaders and the politicians are the REAL rubbish.
1/1	Our liberty bell is ringing for Britain tonight
0/0	Our nation got sold out from under us, and a lot of people here in England very much wish they had the option to bail out.
0	Our only option is to stay in the EU
1/1	Our politician's have definitely let us down big time, they will never be trusted again, will not vote for this two main party's ever again. Brexit is Brexit, Leave means Leave.
1/0	Our politicians and the civil service have failed to deliver any economic benefits. We won't be able to make our own trade deals, control our own tariffs, we won't be able to manipulate our tax rates or employment rights to gain a competitive edge over the EU, nothing.
0/0	Our politicians, are 100% guilty of making the mess we are in, no-one else.
0	Our pound is worthless now
0/0	Our public is more interested in calling the EU "stupid" than discussing real issues. We must look like an embarrassment on an international stage and anyone who thinks No Deal is a sign of strength is deluded by abstract ideas.
0/-1	Our side lost, our system is broken.
0/0	Our struggle to rejoin, will commence, the moment the UK leaves.
1/1	Our trade with EU is a deficit so more money goes out than in.
1/1	Our useless remainer politicians would go right back to business as usual, taking orders from Brussels, if we stayed in the EU.
0/0	Our worst enemy - our most vicious and organised foe - couldn’t possibly inflict more damage on this country than have our own Government and Opposition, with
0/0	Out all people no brexit !! 10 September out in london no brexit !!
1/1	Out for god sake
1/-1	Out is out the people have already voted
1/1	Out means Out the EU is corrupt and run by Globalist's it was not set up with trade in mind. It was the globalist's lying to the people. We do not want a deal, We do not want the EU we just need to walk away on the 29th a march with out giving the corrupt European state one more Euro. The EU is dead.
1/1	Out means out

1/-1/0	Out, out now....
1/1	Out. I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
1/1	Outrageous .. soon as we leave this bunch the better
0/0	Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades.
1/1	Outside of London, away from university campuses, off the Guardian forums the English Leave vote remains rock solid. Absolutely rock solid. So bring on a 2nd referendum and let's shut these metropolitan elites up once and for all. Of course Leave voters should not have to pay a single penny towards this 2nd in/out referendum so the Remainers should crowd fund the entire cost. Maybe Blair & Mandelson can kick in a few of their dubious millions. And when Leave wins yet again all the MPs and members of the House of Lords who campaigned endlessly for this 2nd vote should all resign from their positions as they clearly disrespected the people and so are unfit for office So bring it on. Let's shut these deluded & elitist Remainers up once and for all! B.R.I.N.G. I.T. O.N.
1/1	Outside of the EU and on the edge of Europe. Independent; but hugely wealthy, and in control of European policy in a way that we could never be whilst having our wealth stolen, and imprisoned in a morass of red tape and EU diktats. After all it’s who holds the purse strings that are really in control.
1/1	Outside the EU, Britain could resume its place as a powerful independent power.
1/1	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory
1/1	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory......
0/1	Over a thousand of years of building up enormous international power and influence, being sacrificed in order to be isolated in a global world.I am no historian but I dont think we have or ever will see such a strong nation just voluntarily hand over all its hard earned soft power and good will.
1/1	Over the top bully tactics from the despicable EU. Designed to make things as difficult as it can for the UK. I only wish our government had the guts to do the same in return.
1/1	Over-regulation by the EU has cost the British economy over £125 billion. Freed from EU, the UK economy would thrive like Norway or Switzerland – two of the most successful states in Europe.
0/1	Overjoyed to pay my tax bill today and know that a good chunk of it will be used to implement a project that undermines my commercial activities. Like paying someone to punch you in the face.

1/1	PURE ANTI BREXIT PROPAGANDA FAKE NEWS
0/0	Painful, unpleasant and costly. That’s where we are.
1/-1	Parliament didn't vote to leave. The British people did. The British people are not in charge of the progress of brexit. Parliament is. It is obvious that Parliament has no desire to honor the vote. They are dragging their feet and purposely dragging it out to make everyone miserable enough to just say "fine, cancel it." Absolutely fucking disgusting.
1/1	Parliament is filled with narcissists and psychopaths, good to see Brexiteers standing up to them.
0/0/-1	Parliament is sovereign. If the majority in parliament do not want Brexit, they should stop it.
0/0	Parliament should cancel Brexit because the country is too divided on it.
1/1	Parliament should have NO say, the decision was made in the VOTE TO LEAVE. MAY IS THE PROB:EM.
0/0	Parliament votes for flying pigs only to be disappointed to be told that flying pigs still don't exist.
1/1	Part of the price we would have to pay for staying in the unelected EU would be to turn over our Army and our defence systems to a foreign entity that could in time turn that same army against its own people with impunity
1/1	Parts of the EU are bitter at our decision to leave because, as a net contributor, we subsidise huge parts of it
1/1/1	Patriotism is our strength!

0/0	People DON'T want to leave why can't she understand? THE FAR RIGHT DOESN'T REPRESENT US
1/1	People act like the EU is a perfect organisation keeping the Uk from falling into a frenzy , I would personally like to live in a country which is free to decide their own laws and policies. Which ever way you slice it whether how nice, supportive or beneficial immigrants are i would like a country that worries about sorting its own citizens problems and welfare before other countries. I don't think that makes independence supporters idiots or racists. But hey.. I think John Oliver put it perfectly we just hate other countries for no good reason and would portray us like that just for a Segway 5 average jokes
1/1	People acting like Britain is gonna drift off into the middle of the Atlantic.

0/-1	People in favor of Brexit are Trump supporters.
0/0	People in the UK are moaning about EU membership fees but wait until the European Tariffs on British exports happens (like on Beef and Sheep)...its going to be ugly. Its is every French farmers wet dream to get British meat banned from store shelves.
0/0	People keep saying that the £350 million the UK gives to the EU each year is like dumping loads of money away but they are completely missing the point of how beneficial it is to us.
0/0	People may not realise how the EU strengthens our rights, we cant leave...
0/0	People need to realise that the EU referendum isn't about immigrants, it's about human rights. Leave and we have none
1/1/1	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it
1/1	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it! So Mexico has its Cinco De Mayo and the United Kingdom has its 31st of January to celebrate. Make it a holiday with beers 🍻 and fill the pubs and be waving your Union Jacks for you have given hope to other nations in Europe to break away and reclaim their cultural identity. You even gave hope to us Apaches.
0/0/0	People really don't realise how many problems this country will face by leaving the EU
1/1	People rejected EU becuase it is highjacked by unelected dictators
0/-1	People should be interested in politics. Good politicians can change our lives for the better. Bad politicians can ruin everything. And currently, that's what they're doing. Don't let them get away with it. Fight back!
1/1	People should realise that Brexit is anti-European Union, not anti-immigrant.
0	People should stop pointing the finger and look in the mirror. This country is a joke built on closed minded, greedy people. Soon they'll all be regretting the decision they made when they see it backfire
0/0	People struggle to comprehend how the NAZI party managed to come to power in Germany in 1933. Brexit is very similar. The people of The UK have been manipulated same as the people of Germany were.
0/0	People that think they are safe and won't be affected by this should really go study economics 101. If tens or hundreds of thousands lose their job, there will be less demand on the market and every company will suffer. The EU gave you access to the most prosperous markets on superpower terms, if you think the UK alone will get anything near that you are delusional.
0/0	People that's chose to leave should not be allowed to go to any of EU countries
0/-1	People trade; Countries don’t.
1/1	People voted Brexit because a bunch of idiots in Belgium were bossing you around without any accountability.
0/0	People voted Brexit because they are stupid, ignorant, racist or xenophobic; there is little there to understand.
0/0	People voted Leave only because they saw their current situation, were dissatisfied with it, and believed they could improve it by taking the choice offered to them
0/0	People voted against immigration and thought Brexit will remedy this . Yeah here you go .Well done
1/1	People voted for Leave without this ongoing mess of deal or no deal..Leave means Leaves..go for NO DEAL
1/1	People voted out as they do not want to be run by an undemocratic EU, leader who are unaccountable .
1/1	People voted to leave. What is it that they don't understand?
1/1	People want sovereignty and their vote respected.
0/0	People who support brexit are fucking morons
0/0	People who voted LEAVE will regret their decision!
1/1	People who voted remain were not true patriots
1/1/1	People who were for remain (including media) are just trying to frame it like nobody really wanted Brexit. It was just an accident. Wrong.
1/0	People will need to leave and Britians will be able replace those jobs again. No more welfare cases coming in, Britain will no longer be responsible for Spains Italy's, Francies, and of course GREECE's debt.
0/0	People with their lives ahead of them have to suffer the consequences of a choice by those who are nearly dead.
0/0	People would rather immigration got cut and became poor then having more migration and be more prosper. I think the globalist would lose out the most and bankers
1/1	People, lets be totally honest with ourselves. The EU is crumbling. The French want out, Italy will leave soon, Austria is considering leaving, Hungary will most likely leave within the next 2 years. The people are unhappy with the EU, it doesn't matter what "the facts say" or "what the experts say". People do not like the EU anymore.
1/1	Peoples Vote is what we want
1/1	Perhaps if the forces trying to stop brexit (peoples vote, citizens assembly, meaningful vote etc) had channelled their efforts (and millions) into accepting the vote and trying to get the best exit we wouldn't be in this mess.
0/0	Perhaps that is one of the subconscious reason for Leavers, who seem to genuinely enjoy reliving War fantasies that they never experienced for real.
1/1	Perhaps the British tax payer should be bullied into paying for the exceptionally irresponsible fiscal policies of several EU members.
0	Perhaps the Global Little Britain fantasists will realise that the trio of the Union's biggest players could dominate the future of the Union for decades to come but they thought they had no chance to outsmart France and Germany so the only thing they could do is surrender and cut and run.
1/1	Perhaps you don't understand us Brits, we've been alone before, it's nothing new. Watch this space. The British are coming!
1/1	Personally I dont want to have anything to do with remainers. I'd like them to leave. I dont consider them as part of our community.
1/1	Personally I voted to leave the EU because I didn’t want drunken old megalomaniacs I didn’t vote for, deciding my future. The UK never voted to join Soros’globalist superstate, they voted to join a trade/travel agreement. The EU screws the British worker and violates the fishermen while our woefully pathetic useless MPs turn a blind eye for “some reason £££”.
1/1	Personally I’ve wanted to leave the EU since 1993, when I finally realised that the globalist EU project was all about moving democracy away from the British people & putting our fate in the hands of foreign politicians in a distant land, 90% of whom were not accountable to us.
1/1	Personally my attitude to the bloody EU is just leave, don't give them a penny and trade on WTO rules!
0/0	Personally there's a snowball's chance in hell of me uniting with Brexiters.I'll accept that I'm wrong and happily do it if it proves a roaring success, of course.So, like I said, a snowball's chance in hell.
0/-1/0	Personally, I didn't notice any real change. He was still talking rubbish, still lying, still obfuscating. Yeah, business as usual!
1/1	Personally, I flushed the EU down the toilet back in 2001. It's taking a LONG time for the filth to swirl down into the gutter, isn't it?
1/1	Personally, I made a ton of money off of the event of Brexit and I'll likely make more money once some taxes are gotten rid of that couldn't happen while in the EU.
0/0	Personally, I think that the government should come to its senses and call off Brexit. If the UK leaves with no deal it would be a disaster and the UK will end up becoming even more irrelevant than they already are.
0/0	Personally, I think the EU, while far from perfect, has had a positive effect on the UK as a whole.
0	Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
1/1	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve
1/1	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve. An unelected closed off group of people, shouldn't be able to dictate laws to 28 different countries. I don't feel that the same laws would be effective in two culturally diverse countries.
0/0	Personally...I think we're better together! ✌🏼 #voteremain
1/1	Peter French another delusional remoaner, hate to break it to you but we are out and will forever remain that way.
1/-1	Philip Hammond says no deal Brexit 'a betrayal' as ministers row in behind him.
1/1	Pictured together, the two prime reasons that so many people voted to leave the EU - Junckers and Barnier, arrogant, self-serving, vastly over-rewarded, and self-perpetuating - no way to be rid of them, other than to leave their little racket.
1/1	Pissed theyâ€™ve lost all that tax revenue.
0/0/0	Pity you weren't there when a million of us marched to stop this madness. A minority of the electorate voted for pro Brexit parties in the general election. Opinion polls confirm majority is still anti Brexit. We are leaving without popular consent.
1/1	Plan A = leave,there is no plan B
0/-1	Plan B turns out to be plan A. Will work guaranteed.........she thinks. And so we muddle on towards the cliff.
0/0	Playing into the hands of capitalists who are only too pleased to fan the flames of panic.
0/0	Please Brexiteers stop the WA. I hope the UK destroys itself after the 29th March. This would be so funny.
0/0	Please Britain you haven't got an empire anymore, Britain is a weak country now, Spain and Portugal used to have huge empires and only got influence in the world due to the EU.
0	Please be aware that Scotland and Ireland voted to remain, but apparently democracy has no place in these countries. Their voices are drowned out. Not a good arrangement!
0/0	Please continue fighting to stop this Brexit madness.
0	Please do a video about Brexit in 2018 and the future of England if it leaves the EU
1/1	Please don’t give up now💪💪be example for other Nations! Go_for_Brexit
1/1	Please everyone - you must ignore the vote in camp - they are telling terrible lies everyday. Yes it will be hard for a couple of years but then we're sorted. Â£55 million a day better off. How can that possibly be bad? Save our country - vote leave
1/1	Please god END THIS Weve had enough Brexit 31st and MOVE ON
1/1	Please just get out ! I’d rather eat grass than be controlled but the EU !!!!
0/0	Please leave out the anoying topic of conflict between British and Germans. You re related. And both great nations and admirable democracies. We wish we were British or Germans. Stay in EU. NO ONE will ever challenge the position of UK as a top economical and financial power.
1/1	Please let there be a BREXIT.
0/0	Please please #VoteRemain tomorrow my fellow Brits! Xxx
0/0	Please remember that at least half of Brits, including me, are totally against the madness of brexit.
1/1	Please remove the flags says it all really. The EU feels threatened by the identity of nation states, because its underlying objective is to disempower and ultimately dismantle them. NO THANK YOU AND BYE BYE
0/-1	Please stop calling it the Irish border issue, it’s the UK border in Ireland. The Torries drew the red lines, but expect us to come up with a solution to their problems. Some joke!
1/1/1	Please stop telling us EU is utopia because we don’t care wether it is or not.
0/0	Please stop the UK , Scotland wants to get off
1/1	Please what advantages of staying in? losing jobs is a myth so don’t tell me lies about that one, we have always been able to go and live and holiday abroad so that wouldn’t change. There is nothing but debt austerity and foreign criminals being allowed while we suffer.
0/0	Please, please, please, do hold your breath until the UK rejoins.
0/-1/0	Please. Stop. All this being lied to is exhausting.
0/0	Politicians calling brexit “done” is a horrifying indictment into how little planning they have put in going forwards.
0/1	Poll after poll shows that people who voted to leave have not changed their minds
1/1	Polls are a complete waste of time, they can mean anything you want them to mean, more remoaners propaganda.
0/0	Pompous British think they are the center of the European universe. The EU can go to NYC for financial services, uh oh Brits looks like you going to be hoisted on your own petard.
0/0	Poor ignorant fools, they don't even realize that leaving the EU will only make the situation worse. It's like when people killed cats and dogs during the black death, which only caused the disease to proliferate
0/0	Poor little Britain, sat sulking in the corner. No longer great, and soon no longer Britain, but only England and N Ireland, with Scotland and (probably) Wales gone from the Union. What have you fools done to yourselves?
0/0	Poor misguided souls. By the time they realise the extent of the damage they have caused, it will be too late. Britain will be the Poor Man of Europe once again.
1/1	Poor remoaners. Bbc and guardian, ch 4, Sky keep giving them false hope. Fake news. But they deserve it due to their arrogance.
1	Poor soro$. All of that money spent on globalization for nothing!
0/0	Poor, old farts, not educated, ill informed voted leave and that's a fact.
0/0	Poor, poor Britain. Choosing, all on your own, the destruction of your way of life.
0/0	Poorly informed is a very mild way of describing those who were caught by the Leave campaign. Ignorance is supposed to be bliss but it has got us into a terrible mess.
1/1	Pop the Champagne Brits! You are free to be a sovereign nation once more!
1/1/1	Populism wins. Brexit wins. The people win #Brexit
0/-1	Populist plan is poorly thought out and built on lies?! You don't fucking say.
0/1	Populists in Italy have driven the economy into the wall. UK set to follow soon after March 29
1/-1	Porexit, Portexit or Lusexit Whats the best name for Portugal levaing the EU?
1/1	Possibly, but for the UK it will be worth it in the long run. The EU will suffer much more than the UK, which in effect means the European members, which, personally, I'm sorry for. We voted to do the best for the UK and unfortunately the rest of Europe has to live with it or do the same and get out of that corrupt, non electable bunch of cretans.
1/0	Poverty..... welcome in uk
0/0/0/0	Poverty....welcome in uk

1/1	Praying we leave the EU
1/1	Pre EU we had more jobs such as steel works, mines, pot banks etc hospitals and schools were better
0/0	Pre referendum bbc interviewed expats in sunny spain, this particular group was concerned with the amount of foreigners in uk and were voting brexit
1/1	Precisely! Escaping the clutches of the EU is paramount. Everything else can be sorted later.
1/1	Predictable remoaners response. Read it again remoaners with the bias blinkers off. Article 24 of WTO has potential.
1/1	Prediction: The EU will pretend to be negotiating all the way up until the end of the process and then slam the door shut giving them nothing and blaming it all on the UK.
0/0	Prepare for much worse as the economy goes into decline. There will be real anger directed at Brexiters if that happens.
0/0	Prepare for the anti EU idiots in the comments.
0/0	Presumably Leave voters in Kent will not be stockpiling as they can go for a days shopping in Calais
1/1	Pretty much everything here is a lie- the real truth is that economic co-operation is a good thing but that the attendant and unnecessary political union has led to mass corruption, people want to preserve democracy whilst still free-trading and the E.U. prevents this- let's all of us, the whole world, start to free trade WITHOUT undemocratic corrupt bureaucrats.
0/0/0	Pro Brexit pineapple jackets blocking traffic at Parliament Square today
1/1	Pro Brexit yank here
1/1	Pro British exit is not about "hate" "intolerance" or "anti-diversity". It's about democracy, sovereignty and identity. #Brexit #VoteLeave
1/1	Pro- Brexit all the way. The people voted and Brexit was wanted.
0/0	Pro-tip for anyone who burned an EU flag and objects to being called thick and racist. If you stop being xenophobic, thick and racist then you will not be called xenophobic, thick and racist. It's not quantum mathematics people.
0/0	Probably should stay in the EU.
0/0/-1	Probably the best analysis of the Brexit conundrum
0/0	Problem is, the Brexit was mistake from the start, isteed of leaving the EU, and becoming a tiny little nation on the wimp of multinational Cons and billionars, the people should stayed and tried to reform the EU.
1/1	Problem with remainers they don't and won't see the benefit's of leaving because they are stuck to far up their Ar**s
1/1	Proceed with BREXIT as the voters want. The fragile EU will have no choice other than renegotiate trade with a U.K.
1/1	Professor David Blake, Director of the Pensions Institute at the Cass Business School, has written a paper outlining 10 reasons why staying in the EU ranges from "pretty bad to very, very bad" for pensions. His devastating analysis came as new research by Vote Leave has revealed that just one EU directive due to come in shortly will increase the cost of British pensions by £328 million a year. 'Remainers' you have been warned.
1/1/1	Project Fear = Project Fact Well done England, truly well done
1/1	Project Fear is alive and well! The resolve of the remainders is very apparent in this video.
0/0	Project Fear is certainly working. Every time I hear one of those Brexit people I become more fearful of what they are trying to do to our country.
1/1	Project Fear pushing the speculation button again ! Get Real ! It is all about immigration and control of our borders !
0/0	Project Get Brexit Done is nearly finished, project Keep Stiff Upper Lip will begin shortly!
1/1	Pros: everything cons: nothing Come on. I support brexit but it's obviously going to have negatives. It's going to have positives too. But we can't really say what either will be until we see what the details are.

1/0	Proving Labour’s ProBrexit credentials. I live in a Tory constituency that’s always been blue. I always vote Libdems. I don’t think “oh no the Tories are going to win anyway so I’ll vote Tory too”... if only Remainers - regardless of FPTP had been true to their Remain values
0/0/0	Ps: please, do not forget History. Nationalism is not the solution...
1/1	Pull OUT of EU with NO Deals!! and TELL EU Tough Luck Ya'll. British Don't NEED EU .
0/-1	Pulling out doesn't work, just ask my kids.
0/0	Pulling out is not Always a reliable method
0/0	Pulling out of the huge European single market and going it alone in a hostile global economy can't possibly do anything other than damage our economy which is what many of the Brexit brigade want, in order to reduce net migration.
0/0	Pushing to NO DEAL. 2 weeks mayhem.. emergrncy blocking brexit.. 2nd vote . Back inn.. case closed .

0/0	Putin & Trump want Britain to leave the European Union. No one else in their right minds wants this.
0/0	Putin got what he wanted. Look at the US and the UK. What a mess. The UK should get another vote at it now that they see the mess it is. We get a chance 2 years from now to dig our way out from this dump of Trump.
0/0	Putin is smiling.
0/0	Putin loves brexit veeery much, indeed! It is his second best Investment!

0/0	Question "What exactly are these benefits the working class family will get leaving the EU? Typical Brexiter answer "Shut up remoaner, you lost"
0/0	Question to those in the #Brexit cult: Why do you support the possibility of my 82-year-old dad, who suffers from vascular dementia & diabetes, not being able to get the medicine he needs after March? It should go without saying, but that's a monumentally evil thing to do.
1/-1	Quicker the 29th March comes the better.
0/1/0	Quite right. The anti-American sentiment from some parts of the British public is petty and embarrassing.
0/0	Quite right. This fraudulent #tory government are only interested in their own jobs. They have created #xenophobia and division and complicit by ignoring #corruption with #Brexit #StopBrexit
0/0	Quite sickening how this brexit vote - engineered by a tissue of lies - is causing so much chaos. The BoE had little option, but ultra-low interest rates are hardly to be welcomed - especially by savers. The sooner we reverse brexit the better.
0/0	Quite, and therefore it would have been more sensible to vote to not leave. We could have demanded another referendum at any time in the future, after all.
1/-1	READ THE COMMENTS below pro leave and below pro remain videos; you may be interested by the bias. In my research that bias has shown to be overwhelming to leave.

0/0	Racist a.......s! What shocked me was my local petrol shop owner, a relatively recent immigrant from Sri Lanka told me he had voted Leave. He said ‘all the local Asians have done the same’. When I asked him why he told me ‘ ..there are too many immigrants’!
0/0	Reading some recent articles in Der Speigel which gives a good insight into the European view of things. I think they have come to the conclusion that perhaps the UK is better off out of the EU for a while, let what happens happen. They predict the UK will be buffeted around by superpowers such as America and China et al. There can’t be a single person left in the country who thinks any good will come of Brexit, from high-profile Brexiters such as Rees-Mogg whose city firm quietly relocated to Ireland, and to Farage trousering his EU salary and building up his EU pension rights whilst obtaining German passports for his children. Of the political Brexit class, Der Speigel has been informed that they are so entrenched, they are ‘beyond reason’, with absolutely nothing that comes from the EU table able to satisfy them. Of the ordinary person, leavers seem to be relishing the suffering to come with sangfroid and a Dunkirk spirit. There was a man filmed in McDonalds a few weeks ago on a racist rant claiming ‘our entire civilisation was created by white men’. Brexiters claim to fame will be that the UK will be the only country in the World to have voluntarily regressed and made itself poorer; Brexit, the famous picture of the ascent of man, primate to Homo Sapiens, gradually standing up, but going in reverse.
0/0	Reading these comments, I'm embarrased to be English 😐
1/1	Reading this i would say a no deal is very good for the uk and very bad for the eu. The eu dont want a deasl so we leave and undercut them Thats business and this is what this is all about.
1/1	Real progress will come and England's water supplies will be free. Thank you Boris Johnson.
1/1	Realism and reality is certainly not appreciate these columns by those diehard pro-Remain fanatics who have not yet been cured of their Europhilia.
0/0/0	Reality Check: Could Brexit be negotiated in two years?
0/0	Reality bites, babe! I can remember the author of this piece saying, "if we vote leave, they'll give us a better deal...." How times have changed. Just remember who brought you this shitshow so they can be held to account, and remember the security and prosperity you gave up for your magic Brexit beans.
1/1	Really curious how the EU will function now that the UK has left. More countries to follow?
1/1	Really fed up with all of this we voted out, so let’s just do it
1/1	Really hope this is the beginning of the end of EU that killed all the economy of Italy
1/1	Really looking forward to the EU crashing and burning when they can't cope without the UK's cash.
1/1/1	Really, even though I disagree in full with your statement, you’re still entitled to your opinion; brexit is pretty great!
0/0	Reap what they have sewn sooner the better...... The grass aint greener is it?
0/0	Reasons to be a Remainer? . The following support Leave: 1.Putin 2. Trump 3.Corbyn 4. Farage 5. BNP members Judge a man by his friends, judge a policy by its supporters.
0/0	Recaptured sovereignty is a falsehood
1/1	Recent polls by Tony Blair org suggests a massive rise in people wanting out and May to deliver. If anything its has hardened due to Brussels. A reverse on the referendum would be a breach of democracy and the people’s will. I know of no one who has changed their mind!
1/-1/-1	Reduced to the most basics, Brexit was a fight between the mobile, and well off (who profited from being in the EU) vs the less mobile, not well off (who lost out to e.g. Polish plumbers) To see the data for yourself click below to see Fig 1 https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/107/files/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-13-at-8.33.47-PM.png The caption is, quote "Figure 1 shows the pattern highlighted by other analysts: people in households with incomes over £50,000 were substantially more likely to vote for Remain, and the opposite can be observed in people whose households are at the other end of the income distribution, especially those around £10,000" The more well of now mourn, the less well off celebrate -- LSE is the London School of Economics
1/1	Rees-Mogg's points are precisely why I voted to leave the EU.
1/1	Referendum losers can go live among the world war losers and they can all lose together. And don't worry, when the EU wants to expand into Russia and the middle east with an EU army, it'll purely be in your interests!
0/0	Referendum was never a sane or sensible way to decide the issue
0/0	Reforming the EU, making it better. Not leaving it, but changing it from within.
1/-1	Regain full sovereignity at least. The way the EU is going member states will have less and less sovereignity with time. Moving towards a federal state. One of the main goals of the EU. You can like this, or not, but this is how it is.
0/0/1	Regardless, brexit is still a damage limitation exercise, costing billions with no overall upside for the UK.
1/0	Regret? That's a load of crap. 80% said Brexit was the right choice.
0/0	Regretful Leave voters exist. I am one.
1/1/1/0	Regrets???? I have so far met two people who said they regretted their vote to REMAIN!
1/1	Regrettably leave. It started as the European Coal and Steel Community shortly after WW2 - which obviously, due to it's name - had a focus that was clear and concise with only 6 founding members. It is now just a great big mess consisting of far too many countries with far too many different agendas.
0/-1	Regrexit!!!
1/1	Rejoice! Tonight we bath in the tears of remoaners. Feels good.
1/1	Rejoice! We are free! Our fisherman can now be free! They can fish for fish like never before. Fuck you EU! Ha...we are going to be a beacon to the world with all our British fish.

1/1	Remain means Continue along the Path of Ever Closer Union.” “Leave means Leave.”
0/0	Remain should have emphasised the benefits of EU membership and appealed to a sense of collaboration, community and cooperation.
1/1	Remain should not be on the table..that ship has sailed.
1/0	Remain voters wanted to stay in the EU (including politicians) They lost. Presuming they still wish to stay in the EU why should they have anything to do with the negotiations/arrangements to leave the EU ? If the result had been reversed would leave voters now be holding up UK remaining in the EU?
0/0	Remain were 2 of the countries of the UK, virtually all the Cities, Universities and colleges, and the majority of all those under 52. Remain had all the political parties, Unions Businesses, Nato, the UN, the IMF. Leave were a ramshackle bunch of old age pensioners and a bunch of moronic village idiots - and we allowed that lot to destroy this country - nice one you morons!
0/-1	Remain were ahead in nearly all polls prior to the Brexit vote.
1	Remain will win and historians will look back on this moment and say this was when our country died
0/0	Remain will win, and after that the damn politicians will need to do something tangible to address the real concerns people had before they voted Leave to start healing this fractured country.
1	Remain will win, with a swing induced by the Cox murder. What a travesty.
0/1	Remain won. Leave voters migrate to Syria and leave us in our peace
0/0/0	Remain. Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run
0/0	Remain. Here in NI we are pretty reliant on grants from the EU. Farming is one of the main industries and about half of a farmers income comes directly from the EU. Invest NI, which financially supports a huge number of the bigger employers gets most of their money from the EU. I'm sure it's the same in Scotland and north England. The UK gov only cares about London. If they were in charge itd be a much worse place. This is all without mentioning that Northern Ireland has a physical border with the EU (Ireland) which none of those leave bastards have even tried to address.
0/0/0/0	Remain. I have a full range of economic, political and social arguments for remaining a member of the EU. But, it all boils down to - I don't want to live on a planet where Nigel Farage is right.
0/0	Remain. I want my daughter and her future children to have human rights that Cameron (et al) has been trying to erode. If we weren't in the EU we'd be even more spied on than we already unreasonably are. Voting leave might as well be signing up to have cameras installed in our houses, recording everything like we are criminals. Leaving won't solve immigration at all, nor will it solve any of our financial issues, especially those caused by poor tax evasion management and an unwillingness to change the loopholes.
0	Remain. It would be a disaster for Wales to leave the EU. I am also invested in the EU project and just don't want to leave anyway, but logically as a Welshman I cannot vote to leave the EU because I would literally be voting to cut off a pretty large funding stream to Wales that would not be replaced by any UK government (changes to the Barnett formula are hard, and Scotland also doesn't want them sooooo).
0/0	Remain. My only regret is not taking seriously the chance of leave winning. I just assumed there was no way leave would win so I didn't bother engaging with any debates or discussions in the subject.
0/0	Remain. Only regrets was not realising how old fashioned my family is.
0/0	Remain. The safe, sensible, sane choice.
0/1	Remainer luminaries periodically begging Sinn Fein to save them from Brexit was always one of the more nauseating parts of the anti-Brexit campaign.
1/1	Remainer's are weird, they're like the community that uses crystals to cleans their negative energy......but crystals dont work now do they.
0/1/-1	Remainers - "If we'd stayed in the EU we could help improve it and fix it's problems from within, now we can do nothing" Also Remainers - "You wont win a trade negotiation with the EU they are too strong and too strict, they wont move lines for little England"
1/1	Remainers - its over - move on We have a Country to rebuild
1/1	Remainers are George Soros's shock troops
0/1	Remainers are a broad church with different views.
1/1	Remainers are a nasty bunch. I genuinely believe they have a mental disorder.
1/1	Remainers are all one dimensional thinkers
1/1	Remainers are desperate for Brexit to hurt the economy to protect their arguments but the fact is that we will likely get free trade deals with not just the EU but many other countries and in the long run can flourish outside. The constant bombardment of negativity from them will not stop anything.
1/1	Remainers are still going through the stages of grief, and I take no pleasure in seeing them writhe, however much they schemed to thwart the democratic will of the British people. The reality is, the UK is leaving the anti-democratic, hyper-regulated embrace of the Continent, and Britain is choosing its own path, subject to continuing democratic oversight. You don't like it? Don't play games with technicalities and misrepresent your opponents. Win the next election. Everyone will respect that result.
1/1	Remainers are, almost exclusively, bourgeois, with very little loyalty to anything but capital and nothing but contempt for the poor and the working classes. If they can be richer and posher under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, they will favor dictatorship. They have no allegiance to anything but money and themselves. The EU is a dictatorship that helped make them richer, hence they love the EU and hate the UK. More and more people are realizing that bourgeois liberalism, or "neoliberalism," is anti-democracy. Just look at how the bourgeois liberals spent four years trying to undo a democratic vote for Brexit in the UK and a vote for a president they don't like in the US. Point this out and they pull out their favorite canard: the "Russian hackers." As if a few Facebook ads were all it took for the people their policies have ruined to turn against them.
0/0	Remainers can easily debate the negatives of leaving the EU, but have difficulty discussing the benefits of leaving - probably because there are no leaving benefits. Brexiteers leaving debate is usually "just get on with it", without drawing remainers attention to the benefits of leaving the EU. There appears to be a lack of intellect on one side of the debate.
1/1/1	Remainers conveniently forget that they have spent the last 3 years predicting that we would crash out with a no deal Brexit and that an exit deal (with a transition period) wouldn’t make it through Parliament - facts never bothered them before
1/-1	Remainers have finally grasped the fact that democracy can't be ignored in our country
1/1	Remainers have just ceased to exist! Happy Brexit, my dear fellow Brexiteers. We kept the faith, we fought and we won.
1/1	Remainers kept talking about risking the UKs wealth. I see millions of people on the minimum wage and zero hour contracts. Where is this so called wealth, exactly?
1/1/1	Remainers like telling everyone what to do.
1/1	Remainers made it clear a long time ago they never understood the concept of negotiating.
1/1	Remainers need to get over it, it was an act of democracy, a choice by the people.
1/1	Remainers that think they can win an argument with the EU have lost touch with reality.?
1/1	Remainers told me that the UK is too small to make trade deals and that they could not be done in time before we left the EU. The UK made 20 trade deals with 35 countries, started negotiations with 19 more and made trade continuity deals with the US, Aust and NZ.
1/1	Remainers unable to accept the results are causing the division.
1/1	Remainers, do you remember when you rode a bike for the first time without stabilisers or a parent's guiding hand? That’s Brexit. You may, like that child, feel nervous and frightened now, but the sense of freedom and control will be exhilarating.
1/1	Remainers, everyone: calling anyone who voted differently an idiot.
1/1	Remainers, let it go.
1/1	Remainers??? Move to France..just wild guess
1/0	Remainiac "I voted leave but changed my mind and want another vote" cites Kylie Minogue's "Better the Devil you Know" How appropriate. A song about an abusive relationship that was so dark it even impressed Nick Cave.
1/1	Remaining in any customs union or arangement is not leaving.
0	Remaining in the EU is "better for the education system"! Incredible. "I believe the EU can be reformed"! Amazing. A triumph of hope over experience.
0/0/0	Remaining in the EU was the "good deal."
1/1	Remaining is a risk, a deal is a risk, no deal is a risk. We voted to leave, leave already.
1/1	Remember President Trump made all of this Possible God Bless the people of the UK Great see you got your country back
1/1	Remember people - this is just the beginning of our battle - these Globalists always re-group. The fight for our freedom must continue and we must re-double our efforts - the force that we are fighting against is immense. The Common Law Courts are our most vital resource for wresting free of this global tyrannical machine.
1/1	Remember seeing the result in the morning and jumping for joy. Fuck the EU. Fuck globalism. Rule Britannia!
0/0	Remember that with a No Deal Brexit , UK drivers won't even have a valid license to drive in the EU .
1/0	Remember the EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU remember this
1/-1/-1	Remember the scallop wars? Looks like round two is a possibility
1/1	Remember they have never lived in a free country, they have been brought up under the dictatorship of the EU and every day at school they were told 'what a lovely thing the EU was' - of course they love the EU - that is all they have ever known.
0/0	Remember when they let the british public decided on the name of a boat? And the result was disregarded because they felt the public's decision was too silly to follow through on? That was just the name of a boat.
1/1	Remind me, why do we want to remain? Go Brexit!
0/0	Remind us why deliberately harming our closest trading partners is a good idea
1/1	Reminder that #Brexit hasn't led to the mass exodus of City jobs that some feared - and few signs it will either.
1/1	Reminder: the European Project has destroyed job opportunities for an entire generation of young people around the continent.
0/0	Reminds me of *Lost*. Always some new twist to keep the ratings up.
1/1	Remoaners aren't they, the lot of them? Some morè in the closet than others but remoaners just the same
1/1	Remoaners, why are you still here? Go emigrate. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
0/-1	Remoaners, you were right, the sun has gone!
0/0	Removing the freedom that we had. That’s about as undemocratic as it’s possible to be. Held captive against our will. Is this an illegal act?
1/1	Rename this video 'How Europe lost Britain'. The UK had problems with EU integration/interference for decades, both Labour and Tory Prime MInisters had issues with it. We complained regularly. Nothing was done to placate us, so guess what? We left.
1	Reneging filthy SCUM eu bullies..
1/1/1	Replace the EU’s bad trade deals with our own good ones.
1/1	Representative democracy, true. But millions of Brits rejected the European representative democracy
1/1	Respect democracy. Nothing else matters. People of uk made the decision already. Change the result and you kill democracy forever.
1/1	Respect the people’s vote
1/1	Respect to you Brits!!!
1/0	Rest assured that once all the above is embedded we will have lost control of our own destiny
1/1	Restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy
1/1	Returning confidence to the housing market
0/1	Revenge is a word that appeals to the bonehead mentality of most brexiteers
1/0	Reversing the public vote because they don’t like that. How would you like it if a party in Ireland was elected and banned gay marriage. It would be quite undemocratic wouldn’t it?
0/0	Revert Brexit is the only way for a sustainable NHS. But you only care about the 'will' of the people based upon a NON-binding referendum based on lies.
0/1	Revoke Article 50 now and save your place in the history books as the woman who turned to save the country, her party and the people.
0/0	Revoke Article 50. Stay in EU. All other options are impoverished in comparison.
0/0	Revoke Article 50. no-deal is suicide.
0/-1	Rich playing God with us minions so they can increase their vast wealth. Tories work to serve the super rich and will lie and manipulate us without conscience!
1/1	Rightly or wrongly a decision has been made, now we must move forward as best as we can
1/0	Riots in the street, recession, no medicines, airplanes not flying - enough about France. I thought those outcomes were forecasted for the UK?
0/0	Rip Uk
0/0	Rip brexit. Great day for people in parliament who put the interests of their country before a populist vote based on lies which would damage it. Intelligence and reason are finally prevailing!
0/0	Rising rent and NHS pressures are nothing to do with the EU though. In fact, the Tories are the ones most responsible for pressures on the NHS since they are the ones who are in direct control of its funding and are deliberately starving it of the necessary money required. In spite of this, the doctors and nurses and all the staff in the NHS do an incredible job.
1/1	Risk life and limb to Brexit!! The EU is getting real scary. If you dont get out now you will never be able to get out... God save Britain, and maybe the queen will save the people from the treachery of their leaders!!!
1/1/1	Robbins must have deliberately negotiated the worst deal in history to help delay or stop Brexit.
1/1	Roll of 2017 with the big fat yes to get out. lets leave the eu and not end up like Greece.
1/1	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!
1/0	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!?
0/0	Rubbish - this country is already being torn apart by a greedy elite of brexiteers! Happy to condemn future generations to a much less attractive future due to some delusional 'freedom' - roll on general election
1/1	Rubbish we will be fine. It will be difficult at first but we will rise to being Great Britain once more
0/0	Rubbish. Airbus is responsible for 100,000 British jobs and he’s the CEO. It’s no different to repeated warnings from South African CEO of carmakers etc. The Brexidiots look for any excuse not to listen and blame everyone else for the fact Brexit is not achievable.
1/1	Rubbish. How much influence did we really bring while we were full members of the EU? Dream on.
1/1	Rubbish. Paying billions for a trade DEFICIT and unlimited low-skilled EU immigration etc etc. is a very bad idea. It's as straightforward and obvious as that. More importantly, the rotten and corrupt EU organisation is completely undemocratic.
0/1	Rue the day. What a terrible decision they have made. The UK is heading for disaster and these MPs are supporting the worse prime minster in modern times.
0/1	Rule Britannia again
1/1	Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves! Britains never never never shall be slaves!
1/1	Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves! Britains never, never, never shall be slaves!

0/1	Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves; Britons never will be slaves. (That's indeed all what you will rule, the waves around your minuscule island.)
1/1	Run as fast as we can and don't look back...
0/0	Russia and China want a Brexit, it’ll weaken Europe’s unity which will make them easier to take over.
0/-1	Russia has achieved its goal. To create chaos and turmoil in the US and UK.
0/0	Russia is so happy with brexit.
1/1	S0d Remainers.We've had three years of them wrecking the social cohesion and economy of the Country, Now's the time to unite and get deals done with that great big world out there and let the EU rot in its own protectionist, shrinking juice!
1/1	SAVE your Country And GET OUT OF THE EU !!
1/1	SAVED FROM 43 YEARS SHACKLED TO THE EU
0/-1/0	SF are less populist than the Brexit wing of the Tories. SF hold a high line against anti immigration policies and against racism & anti lgbt stances. Not necessarily what it’s “base” might what. They are economically populist. And I’m not a fan of SF but credit where credit due
1/1	SIR NIGEL FARAGE: National HERO, great patriot of British history - living LEGEND !!! :-)

0/0	Sad dark times ...they might drag us out of the EU but they can’t drag the EU out our hearts
0/0	Sad day but I'm honestly done with politics. Between the clownshow that is Trump in America and Brexit it's too toxic and not worth the mental strain it puts on our lives. I'll keep up with key policy changes but there's no point following this circus day to day.
0/0/0	Sad day for Britain.
0/1	Sad day for EU ( no more money from UK)
1/0	Sad day for europe, I did not want the UK to leave(am from GER)
0/0	Sad day for the UK, if it even remains the UK for much longer. Truly upsetting that ignorance and deliberate disinformation is becoming the norm in critical domestic and international decision-making across the globe.
0/0	Sad day for the United Kingdom.
0/0	Sad day for this great country and her allies
0/0	Sad day. #brexit
0/0	Sad day...but so many simple minded people swallowed the xenophobic little Englander lies...now they will pay.
0/0	Sad sad day. End of an era. However Brexit is a generational thing and it won’t be long before the pro EU young are in the majority and can claim their access rights back. Every dog has its day.
0/-1	Sad state of affairs.
0/0	Sad times. 2020 is a bad year.
0/0/0	Sad to be British today; we were once respected the world over for pragmatism and tolerance. We are about to start the only trade talks in history where the starting point is free trade and we are going to discuss what barriers we put up. You couldn't invent it!!! Churchill will be turning in his grave.

0/0	Sad to say, but the whole #brexit shambles leaves me ashamed & embarrassed to be British. The effects on science & the economy will be devastating. Image how we’d flourish if we #remain. I’m far from the only academic thinking the next move should be abroad & away from this mess.
0/0	Sad to see you leave, but we wish you all the best, all that jazz.
0/0	Sad, angry, and scared for our country this morning.
0/0/0/0/0	Sad, really sad. Why all the hate towards hard working people? Brexit really is Brexshit
1/1	Saddened by reports from Brussels, but the message is clear, we are not safer in Europe #brexit #voteleave
1/1/0	Sadly I think that it is inevitable that the UK will leave the EU. That said, as things stand I would not support continued membership.
0/0	Sadly normal leavers wont really benefit from Leave and they are likely to suffer from it.
0/0	Sadly the majority voted for the soundbites and had no clue what it was about. Mist I speak with say things like. Get back our laws.. we had our laws already.. have sovereigncy.. we had it already. Stop EU controlling us... we were a voice in the EU and did control ourselves
0/0	Sadly what we are experiencing now is the reality of Brexit, the country was divided as the house of commons is and it would be impossible to get in to concences when the out date is so close.
0	Sadly, this is the downside of a 'free press'.
0/-1	Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU’s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,” it said in a statement. “The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.
0/0	Said it before. Completely regret my vote. I got caught up in the anti EU/sovereignty fervor and was just desperate for some big change somewhere, somehow. I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government. I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
0	Sajid Javid fails to dismiss claims by three experts that Britain will be a lot less safe, whatever Brexit deal is agreed
1/-1	Salty MEP tears. MEPs are unskilled, talentless pen pushers. So happy to see them unemployed. No one will hire them.
0/0	Same I'm 6 months too young :( wanted to boost the remain campaign
0/0	Same as aircraft engineers have to have EU licenses and qualifications. Those issued in UK will not be accepted in EU airports. Friends of mine in Spain are having a nightmare.
0/0	Same people that voted for Brexit are the ones that will suffer it’s consequence
0/0	Same people that voted for Brexit are the ones that will suffer it’s consequence.
1/1/1	Same problem here. People and politicians refusing to respect and OBEY the will/vote of the people. THAT'S WHY WE VOTE!!! A GREAT DAY FOR THE UK and AMERICA. Trump acquitted soon. Victory to the people.
1/-1	Satanism is our only hope...
1/1/1	Satisfaction, that is what it means to me. We defeated those treacherous swine that were working against their own country and people. Today is a great day.
1/1/1	Save Brexit otherwise people divided it’s good for England

0/0	Say no to xenophobia. Say no to needless economic strife. Say no to blaming the EU for the mess the Tories have made of the NHS, housing and immigration control. Say yes to tolerance. Say yes to the common market, to trade and investment. Say yes to elections deciding the future direction of this country. Vote Remain.
1/-1	Say this 5 times fast: Brexit’s Biscuit Brisket for Breakfast,
1/1	Scandinavian MEPs offer to create a Nordic trading bloc with UK Sweden Norway Denmark Finland Iceland when we Brexit. We have similar histories and cultures. Many EU countries want us to lead the way and Brexit so they can get out of the EU also. We have friends. Take heart, keep the faith, and VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Scapegoating the EU by our politicians and media was always going to come to a head at some point is was unsustainable and short sighted. However I doubt it will stop even now, people won’t learn this lesson, it’s really quite sad.
1/1	Scaremongering by the big Rip off supermarkets lol . The Worlds not going to End because we are leaving the E.U lol
1/1	Science is uncovering that "remainers" can actually be used as an energy source. Just another example of technology solving problems and turning something that is completely useless into a brighter future.

0/0	Scotland leaves to join the EU
0/0	Scotland leaving the UK = they are going to be on their own. UK leaving the EU = act of selfdetermination, freedom and democracy? For as long as people are able to tell lies like he does, direct decomcratic referendums are an endangerment for every society.
0/0	Scotland needs another independence vote and fast. I'm so sick of being grouped together and dumped on for brexit because of some racist fucks in England.
0/0	Scotland really should go independent, and look to a likely rejoining of the EU in the long term future.
0/0	Scotland should go independent. Best of luck to England with Brexit but we should go our own way now
0/1	Scotland should leave the UK too.

1/1	Second referendum has been vaporised. All roads lead to no deal. Well done Brexiteers! Our goal is in sight.
1/1	Second referendum means democracy is dead.
0/-1	Security costs money, so it's perfectly reasonable to insist that the EU pays towards the costs.
1/1/1	See EU later

1/1	Seeing this video I am more proBrexit than ever
0/0	Seems Boris wants to cosy up with the US, the most protectionist country there is by far! So the UK is whistling by their tune then, allowing low health, safety and food standards, workers rights... Is this what you meant by "taking back control"?
0/0	Seems Brexit happening tonight is going to be the political version of the anti-climax when people ask you on your birthday "do you feel older/different?!?" Nope, just same old rubbish really.
0/-1	Seems like I am surrounded by fools in the stands.
0/0	Seems like a bad deal to me. We should just stay in.
0/1/0/0	Seems like a disaster to me.
0/0	Seems like a good example of why not to inject major direct democracy elements into a representative system
0/0	Seems like there should be a re-vote.
1/1	Seems that when Mandelson said the Blair and Brown governments deliberately engineered mass immigration, the former Cabinet Minister and spin doctor said New Labour sought out foreign workers. it was ok to hand out top down governance because the Working Classes didn't matter in the great Labour scheme to impose diversity on the UK, without a referendum I might add.
1/1	Seems the EU is really showing their fear and their contempt for democracy.
0/1	Seems to me the UK should join some sort of European union
1/-1	Seen lots of people losing their followers and having to start afresh, so let’s do this again.
0/-1	Self approval that “we are normal people “doesn’t sound convincing.
1/1/1	Self determination is a major reason. The EU went WAY too far when they started to tell EU member countries how many immigrants/refugees they had to take in to become citizens of their countries. Trade is one thing, who is going to be a citizen of YOUR country is quite another. The "masters" in Brussels lost the plot and got too comfortable with their power. The UK didn't like the rules they were required to play under so they took their ball and went home because that was the best course of action for them.
1/1	Self government is a great thing.
0/0	Self inflicted harm for sure due to too much self confidence arrogance and egotism of the english politicians.
0/0	Self-centred, narrow-minded, xenophobic liars have won.

0/0	Sensible move, brexit Britain will destroy itself within a year.
0/0	Serious question. Why are brexit voters so old, F-A-T and U-G-L-Y?
1/1	Serious reply. I'm Irish, and I've lived in the UK 4 Years for work. The country, for whatever reason, gave me the ability to vote in the election. Even in Ireland, we only let irish nationals vote on things like constitution changes. But England gave me the right to vote. And there's a lot of fucking history between Ireland and England. So I used that vote to Vote Leave. Mainly because it would be hilarious! It's still hilarious. I have now gone back to Ireland.
0/0	Seriously Simon? How many pro-Brexit articles have you written over the years? You're an educated man,wasn't this stuff obvious from the start?
1/0	Seriously now, the UK will leave the EU,no doubt about it. This Brexit thing is getting kinda old.Not saying the UK isn't important (deal,no deal, what kind....) but the EU also has other things on it's agenda
0/0	Seriously, honor and pride can't bring back good old days.
0/1	Seriously? They didn't know what they were voting for? Goodness christ.
0/0	Seven privileged wealthy late middle aged white men sitting in front of a collapsing sign saying "Global Britain." Well that's me sold. #ERG
0/0	Shame on those who lied an cheated and stoked hatred and conned people into voting for an impossible idea that would make them poorer, cost them jobs, strip them of rights, and humiliate this country, all so that the Brexit elite and their pals could get richer. Shame on them!
0/-1	Shame on you if you were a part of this
0/-1	Shame uk leaving eu but no one know what's going to happen after December 31st yes it be hard. UK could surprise everyone. Or maybe not only time will tell

0/0	She got her country back? What? I don't think UK was captured by anybody. Delusional.
1/1	She has lost my vote and it really is a bit late to start banging the table now.   All I wanted was to leave the club.
0/0/0	She is the biggest #Brexit ier and hides behind her leopard skin shoes. See clip when she looks at Osbourne. She want to deliver by running down the clock. #InsideEurope real #theresamay
1/1	She knew what she was saying. Good riddance we are out of the EU, we will be much stronger without these leeches
0/0	She listened to British industry and not the table of clowns that sit around her with their degrees and no real work experience on their CVs. You voted them into power. She's doing her job. Suck it up. Brexit is the biggest waste of time and distraction this country has ever had to deal with. Millions of resources and hours diverted away from the real issues that count - Education. Health. Environment. Those who voted out should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
1/1	She must be being paid by the EU to keep lying to the UK
1/1	She told MP's 'If you want Brexit you have to vote for it'. We have already voted, and the people voted OUT, nothing to do with MP's. OUT MEANS OUT. Project fear must not win.
1/1	She will not let us leave,she has lied all along.
0/0	Shedding a tear tonight and keeping a candle lit in the hope UK may eventually rejoin EU.

1/1	Short term some pain economically, longer term stable or growth economically. It will be nowhere near as bad as most people here want it to be.
0/1	Shortest answer: don't. A no deal Brexit still achieves the sovereignty the voters were looking for, whilst not paying billions of EUROs in fees to the European Union.
1/1	Should be a national holiday
1/-1	Should become a bank holiday and call it remembrance Brexit
1/1	Should have left two years ago.
0/0	Should have read the small print, Brexit comes with reams of it.

1/1	Should of left with no deal the day after the referendum result. The less we have to do with that corrupt, undemocratic, self serving protection racket the better.
0/1	Should the UK leave not so much left of a UNITED Kingdom. Scotland will have another referendum and will separate this time.
0/0	Should the UK left be optimistic about our future outside the EU? No, they should stop farting around, get together and stop it happening.
0/0	Should you be able to vote yes to brexit if you can't wipe your own ass...
0/0	Should've changed the EU from the inside instead of leaving. You're in for a shitstorm now and it ain't gonna get better anytime soon.
1/1	Shouldn't it be 'How the EU lost Britain' I mean, people only voted Brexit because the EU told David Cameron to do one when he asked for concessions. It'll be the EU that looses out in the longterm. Good luck to the EU without Britains clout.
1/-1	Shouldn’t we be celebrating and embracing leaving the EU, rather than avoiding referring to it? Assuming it’s a positive thing in the main? I mean, the government does think it’s a positive thing, yes? Johnson wouldn’t be proBrexit just to gain power and win over supporters?
1/-1	Show courage and integrity.
1/1	Show me a Remainiac who ISN'T,in Receipt of huge amounts of FREE EUrinal Cash for doing VERY LITTLE.....And,I'll introduce you to my Unicorn I keep in the Garden....

1/1	Shows why you have to fight, kick and punch the teeth out of libtards. If you do that, you can prevail!
1/1	Shrink it? I don't give a toss. An economy cannot increase forever. I would have an exit from the EU, and complete withdrawal from any refugee/asylum seeker/economic migrant acceptance quotas.
1/1	Shup up Crisp.....the EU has just referred to Gibraltar as a 'Colony' you idiot. They are not friends they are in fact the enemy. The same enemy that we fought two world wars against..this is war in just another guise. So get your head out of your backside and start contributing to the safety of our island you clown.
1/-1	Shut up and go back to your country. You dont belong in EU.
1/1	Sick of it myself. The irony is that Brexit will ensure the UK, as a distinctive, independent entity, isn't destroyed and also that we will become more capable as we're forced to stand on our own two feet and confront the world as a truly soverign nation.
1/1/1	Sigh they are getting desperate in their anti-brexit proaganda. Role on 29th March, no deal, no problem, no delay, no surrender.
0/0	Sigh. why my 401K gotta suffer cuz the UK don't want immigrants? Never mind a #Brexit it's gonna be an #Amexit if we don't vote right .

1/1	Sign this confession or we will torture you. Frightening stuff, but nothing less than was to be expected from the bully-boy EU.
1/1	Silly Eurocrats believed that more rules and regulations 'make life better', but the only thing that comes from more laws is more 'law breakers'.  So glad Britain has finally left that stupid EU! I am looking forward to normal lightbulbs again, no VAT on electricity and gas that will result in lower energy bills, and the ability of people in the UK to decide on what rules if any, we want. Time to build a massive bonfire outside 10 Downing Street and throw all the volumes of books that contain all the silly EU rules and burn them!
0/0	Silver lining, ten years down the line might be a vote to rejoin
0/0	Similarly opinion polls have shown that the majority of people no longer support leaving
1/1/1	Simple answer to that question,WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. and screw brussels.
0/0/-1	Simple answer, NO WE SHOULD NOT!! The Magna Carta was the foundation of freedom for SOME, so it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. As long as I don’t steal your horse or make a roof out of your twigs… I’ll be OK!
1/1	Simple fact None of this would've happened if the EU wasn't run by people with a desire for a superstate/federalism If the EU had shown it's open to genuine reform away from ever closer political & monetary union as even G Soros says they should We wouldn't have voted Leave
0/0	Simple solution:stay on European Union!
1/1	Simple, don't feed the gimmigrants and asylum suckers and there will be more edibles left for us! If you don't speak proper English, no food for you!
0/0	Simple. Do what we did before we joined the EU. What do you think we should spend the extra £165 million a week on that we will have when we leave?
1/1	Simply Superb . Thank you for being so strong Prime Minister . The United Kingdom needs you Encourage Southern Ireland to join us by leaving the EU `Block `. link arms and become the political British Isles again . Sorry Brussels .. Check Mate .
1/1/1	Simply leaving the EU means Brexit was successful. Mission accomplished.
0/1	Since 11pm, 29 March 2019, the UK has paid the EU £9,247,930,237.05. This could've paid for 102 new hospitals, 402,083 nurses, 350,951 policemen, or even the repair of 174,489,249 potholes. A single pile of what we've paid in £20 notes would be 32.47 miles tall. #BrexitBetrayal
0/0	Since 1973 when the UK joined the (then) EEC not one prime minister of either party has recommended leaving the EU. Is that because they were all traitors? Is it that they knew the impact on UK economically, socially and internationally?
0/0	Since 2012 there has not been a single remain supporting MEP on Question Time. That’s a clear pro Brexit bias by the BBC
1/1	Since Poland and the other eastern European nations joined the EU in 2004, migrants have used the Union’s free labour movement rules to flood the UK.
1/0	Since our time as an EU member, how many companies have closed their operations in the UK and re-opened elsewhere in Europe with an EU grant? and how many more will if we vote remain? The REMAINERS are totally naive, once we are totally caught in the EU web we will be fleeced to fund and rebuild 'poorer countries' and the doom and gloom REMAINERS predictions will come true BUT because we remained! What guarantees have the EU given that this won't happen NONE! We must have OUR own democratically elected Government to not only protect and look after our country and the wellbeing of its citizens. VOTE LEAVE!
0/0/1	Since we've been in the EU we've had to concentrate our war efforts on more distant targets. This is a bit of a bugger logistically. As has been said below, as soon as we distance ourselves from Europe we always end up at war with some of them. This will create loads of local armaments jobs and, given their proximity ability to fight back, should lead to a major boost to our construction industry. The rapid population reduction will also take the pressure off our public services. Think back to pictures of London/ Berlin in 1947. Yes we'll be poor, starving, diseased, bereaved, depressed but at least we'll be free from regulation. The main reason for staying inside the EU is that it stops our egotistical, sabre rattling politicians (and Royals) from killing 'the evil foreigners' or asking our children to die fighting to keep them in power. I accept that this approach doesn't sell as many tabloids but I think its a price worth paying.
0/0	Since when did Brexit supporters pay any attention to experts?
0/0	Since when did brexiteers think about the economy? This is all about, following their xenephobic fantasies and building a hard Irish border so we can return to 70s and 80s with IRA car bombs.

0	Sneering contempt for people's valued freedoms and rights, thrown away to satisfy the self pitying victim fixation of poorly educated saps at the behest of disaster capitalists and the Etonian elite is the real problem facing post Brexit Britain.
1/0	Snowflake Londoners didn't get their own way for once! Nice!!
1/1	So #Ivotedleave because I believe Britain should return to being a self-governing democracy and will be much better for it.
0/-1	So .... if it is going to be painful for Germany, what will the UK feel ?
0/0	So @Keir_Starmerwhat would you like the argument to move on to? @jessphillipshas been very clear that our country is better off in the EU & will hold Johnson to account. As a #Remainer I'm not bowing to Johnsons wish that we now just unite & accept Brexit...
0/0/1	So @theresa_may's current Brexit 'strategy' is to say to the EU "Well I love the deal you and I spent two years shaping, BUT I'm telling my MPs to support an amendment from one of my MPs saying it's shit." What a cowardly approach. It's shameful.
0/0/0	So Brexit day has finally come. It's a sad day for many, myself included. I still hope my country can find its way back, I don't know how long it'll take or how hard things will get, but I (and many others) will never give up on EU.
0/0	So Brexit was about opening doors to people from common wealth LOL
0/0	So Brexshitters playing bingo with 66 million people's faith on the stake? Interesting. Why don't they just go out the streets and shoot random people. That would be less harmful than brexit.
0/0	So Britain died today because of the English. Who are now officially the most hated people on earth. I'm going to spend the next few years sitting by my pool in my luxury villa in Spain laughing while England burns. You've made your bed of nails now you can lay in it - you absolute mugs. I'm looking forward to becoming Scottish and I'm now supporting Iceland in the Euros. The English are the scum of the earth.
0/0	So British people hate immigration enough to leave the Eu but Donald Trump is looked down upon by British politicians for saying that he inflict a temporary ban on a nations people who have attacked the US? And show strong resentment towards the US?
0	So Bye, Bye made the Globalist cry
1/-1	So Bye, Bye made the Globalist cry, Brussels was a Hustle so we said goodbye; Those good ol' Europeans were crying asking why, Singing this'll be how the EU dies, this'll be how the EU dies;
1/1	So Germany resisting backstop changes. This is one of the reasons I voted ‘Leave’. The EU is not a partnership of equals but a club run by Germany for their benefit. Germany sets the agenda and is behind all the key decisions. Everyone else is left to feed on scraps. Yes, Macron is trying to muscle in and make it a Franco-German club as it used to be in the days of the Common Market but he’ll soon be pushed to one side.
1/1	So Germany successfully conquered Europe after all.. just more than 50 years later after WW2 and without the use of weapons
0/0	So Great-Britain is basically acting like an entitled mom. GOT IT!
1/1	So I gather they think it’s game over. The Bremainers think they have bombed us into submission. They think that we have just seen the turning point in the referendum campaign, and that the British people are so intimidated by these testimonials – American presidents, business leaders, fat cats of every description – that they now believe the British people will file meekly to the polls in two months time and consent to stay in the EU; and thereby to the slow and insidious erosion of democracy in this country. If that is indeed the view of the Remain campaign, they are crowing too soon. They are perhaps ignoring the resilience and thoughtfulness of many middle-of-the-roaders. One senior public servant – a man of no political party, and who had previously been on the fence – texted me after the US intervention and said he had been so outraged at President Obama’s “back of the queue” remark that he had instantly decided to vote Leave. But let us suppose that the Bremainers are right in their complacency. Let’s imagine that we all wake up on June 24, and discover that the people have indeed been so cowed and so perplexed by the scare stories that they voted to Remain. What then? There will be instant jubilation in Brussels, of course; champagne corks going off like Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture. Among the vast clerisy of lobbyists and corporate affairs gurus – all the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat – there will be relief. Things will go on as they are; indeed, things will go into overdrive. For more than a year now, Brussels has been in a self-imposed lockdown. Nothing must be done to frighten the children. The British referendum – that embarrassing and tedious genuflection to democracy – must be safely won; and then they will get their plans out of the drawer and get on with the business of building a federal superstate. You may have noticed, however, that the euro crisis is far from over, and that the EU remains a gigantic engine of job destruction. Eight years after the disaster began, it is obvious that the problem is structural, not cyclical. In Spain, Portugal and Greece, a whole generation of young people has been sacrificed to the Moloch of the euro – and they are still on the dole. The Greeks are unable to pay their debts; the Italian banks have a €360 billion black hole. In response, the EU plans “more Europe”, a fiscal and political union, in which Britain would inevitably be involved. Remember we were told we wouldn’t have to pay for the Greek bail-outs? And then we did? According to the European Commission’s Five Presidents’ Report, which lays out plans to shore up the euro, the Commission wants to have a new European approach to company law, to property rights, to every aspect of employment law. Why? Because if the Germans are to be persuaded to engage in a perpetual bankrolling of the less prosperous regions of the EU, then they want proper Germanic rules to enforce good behaviour. He who pays the piper calls the tune. And Brussels can see only one way to save the euro – and that is to get Germany to pay, and therefore to allow Germany to call the tune. Remember that twice in the last five years, the EU has removed a democratically elected government – in Italy and Greece – and installed Brussels-approved technocrats. It is a narcotic tyranny. They want to go on with the work of building a unitary state, in a way that is anti-democratic and ultimately very dangerous, since it will one day provoke real public anger. Britain should not be involved in any of this – and yet we have absurdly and inexcusably given up our veto rights; and the whole process is going to be conducted within the “single market” – that is, the existing EU structures – so that we are morally and legally comprised, and share all the ensuing political and economic damage. Inch by inch, month by month, the sausage machine of EU law-making will extrude more laws – at a rate of 2,500 a year, or perhaps even faster, once the referendum is out of the way. More and more people will exercise their unfettered rights to come to this country, putting more pressure on our public services. And eventually – when we are unable to take it any more – the UK will utter a faint sheepish cough of protest. Please sir, we will say, raising our hand in the EU Council, we need reform. And eyebrows will shoot up in a Batemanesque way. REFORM? they will say, in the tones of Lady Bracknell. REFORM? But you just had reform… If there is one thing that proves the folly of remaining in the EU – in the hope that we can change things from within – it is the tragic poverty of that deal. The Prime Minister asked to restore social and employment legislation to national control; for a complete opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental rights; to stop the European court adjudicating on UK criminal law; to ensure that immigrants have a job offer before entering the UK; to revise the Working Time directive to protect the NHS; to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the structural funds; and full-on Treaty change. What did we get? Two thirds of diddly squat. We need to talk about that deal in the weeks ahead, because it shows how contemptuously we will be treated if we vote to remain. This is the last chance, in our lifetimes, to take back control – of £350m a week (and use some of that cash to deliver a seven-day NHS) – and the last chance to take back control of our democracy. Of course the elites want to remain. They will always have power. The losers are the hundreds of millions of Europeans whose only power is their vote – their ability to sack their governments at elections. That power is being taken away. It is indefensible, and it will lead to real trouble. We can be stronger, richer, more influential if we vote Leave. In believing that we can all be scared into thinking otherwise, the Remainers are fatally underestimating the British public.
0/0	So I suppose a 57% rise in reported hate crime in the UK post Brexit is just a coincidence? You don't fool me trying to disguise your racist mentality with the label sovereignty.
0/1	So I think it is a bad decision for the UK, and probably for the EU itself in the short term. However, as a European Federalist, I am kind of glad that the most cumbersome and anti-federation member decided to leave. Since the Brexit vote, the European project started again, also thanks to Trump wrecking havoc in US-EU relationships and thanks to the impulse of Macron. I prefer a smaller but better integrated EU, so in the end, I am fine with euroskeptic members leaving.
1/1	So I'm new and up until last night I wanted The UK to Remain in The EU... Today I want The UK to Leave and be an example to the EU. I am pretty young, late 20s, in an ok job in eastern England. I've lived and travelled around The UK a bit due to parents and academic pursuits. At the end of my University career I left The UK to work in North America, the difference was stark and I don't really mean culturally. There you have people active in their communities fighting for changes in the local area, usually with results - be it town/city/countywide. A strong sense of national identity and a desire to create a better world for themselves. An upfront and fair way of giving jobs to foreign nationals in lieu of a citizen, which works. Freedom to decide what they do with the money collected with taxes locally, stately/provincially or countrywide.. Doesn't that all sound great? As a young Briton, I've begun to ask myself why aren't we like that anymore? I've been told by grandparents and older colleagues of a different time... What happened? The EU happened. The EU has brought about some good things, sure. I was someone who once thought if we left The EU all those rights will be eroded away. Will it really, would we let our Government do that to us, or would we, as a once again truly independent nation, stand up for what we believe in? I know I would! We don't need anyone to decide what's best for us... We've known it all along... We knew it before we joined, we know it now and we'll know it when the time comes to take off the Blue and Gold jacket. We won't be isolated, we won't be cut off and we won't be worse off. We'll be free to do what we want, live how we want and spend how we want. I know no different from The EU, but I don't think I want to carry on in this pantomime any longer!
1/-1	So Reddit is now on the side of the super rich tax evading heaven. Cool cool

0/0	So according to some, people are weaker together. Economic prosperity is attained by having it bound to borders and delays. And war is averted if you do not co-operate with your neighbors by putting up restrictions. It's the inverse of what history should've thought us. But it seems yet again, people will never learn.
1/0/-1	So according to this the only good thing about brexit is the apple business profiting

0/0	So areas that had most recent migration were more inclined to vote remain, and areas most reliant on inward EU investment voted to leave. Funny old world.
0/0	So as someone who lives in the U.S. I see this like if Texas for example seceded from the Union. They can no longer travel to Louisiana or anywhere else in the U.S. Without a visa and its messes up who trading and stuff like that goes.

0/0	So far we have only notionally "left" and we are already seeing the start of an economic downturn.

1/0	So foolish.
0/0	So for my understanding in simple terms UK leaves the EU and tries to make it so they get the best advantage against everyone else in Europe (trade etc). Since the EU is a coalition they say fuck off that's not how it works. UK is now omg how could this have happened! Is that the jist of it?
0/0	So for those having a party and celebrating with a bottle of bubbly from France ( Champagne) Italy (Prosecco) or Spain (Cava) bottoms up, as you will soon be finding all those things you have taken for granted evaporating - but you all knew that anyway, didn't you?

0/0	So it’s okay to lie, cheat, bribe, intimidate to win an election? You would manipulate votes and suppress voter turnout to win an election, then call it legitimate?
1/-1	So let me get this straight: The UK can now make memes again?
1/1	So let's grow more local food. Better all round.
1/1	So lets get Britain out of the crumbling EU mess.
0/0	So little gained so much lost.... you realize that while UK might gain a little money by this, most people will lose money right?
1/1	So long Britain and good luck! Well deserved.
1/1/1	So long as we leave the EU completely I'm all for it,, just Don't try to keep us in it or there will be trouble for sure,, the EU is finished and is an out dated ideology that's failed 600million people
1/1	So long, and thanks for (taking) all the fish.
1/1	So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen to EU.
0/0	So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodnight We'd like to stay, but we've been taken over by the far right ... So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen #WeLoveEU #Brexit
1/1	So looking forward to seeing the EU27 countries brought to their knees. Roll-on 31st January 2020 at 11pm GOODBYE EU 😊🇬🇧
1/1	So many EU bootlickers, let me tell you that EU was so upset about brexit and you know why? Because they lost a wallet.
0/0	So many companies didn't say a word, these just moved HQ already. Almost all the banks will do so if no deal happens.
0/0	So many inbred island folks in 1 video :-)
0/0	So many people happy with this party going on, we will see how THE hangover will go :))
1/1	So many people in this thread that are pro EU forget the fact that WE voted to leave you because the EU is a failed idea
0/0	So millions of voters just potentially doomed millions of innocent immigrants. At this point in history mankind is more bad then good. That's a scary thought.
1/1	So much for a democratic vote to leave the European Union. The political elite were never going to let us leave. Talk about betrayal!
1/1	So much for the Remoaner lie that the UK would have to apply to join the WTO then.
0/1	So much for the new world order. God save the Queen! Pip pip and a cheerio!
0/1/1	So much lefty bias
0/0	So much mess and confusion. Just recind article 50. We don't actually want to leave!!
1/1	So much more reason in life for us now
0/0/0	So much of the agenda behind Brexit has been murky.
1/1	So nice to be in control of our own destiny.
0/-1	So now non-politicians are being forced to lie
1/1	So now the EU can damage itself to destruction and the UK can move on unscathed as part of the free World.
0/0	So pretty much this happened because of an ignorant, old, and outdated way of thinking. I dont get it, why didn't the young ones get out and vote against this?
0/0	So pro brexit people when do you guys plan to rejoin the EU after all this nonsense is over?
1/1	So proud of Britain....congratulations for your leading role in the end of globalism
1/1	So proud of the British. Breaking away from the Neo-marxist globalist regime.
0/0	So proud of the people from my home town who do not support leaving the EU. Europe, please leave a light on for those of us who did not want #BrexitReality #IamEuropean that will not change with #Brexit
1/1	So proud of you Brits for recognizing the importance of being British. Despite what the left wants everyone to believe, I know it has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with governing yourselves and retaining your incredible history and culture. We'll be watching closely as you transition back to being you. God bless you and your country!!!!!
1/1	So proud, never thought we would get there. Well done Brexiteers.
0/0/0	So sad :(. I was really hoping something similar to the eu would spread across the world.
0/0	So sad to say goodbye to our British friends. Always better together.
0/0/0	So sad today, this is a huge mistake. Sorry Europe.
0/0	So sad!! Everyone is celebrating for their own reason.But they will soon realise the mitakes!!
0/0	So sick of this story. You Brits are nuts for wanting to leave the EU. Just nuts. We had more than 70 years of peace. How the hell can you even think of gambling with that? Especially in times with lunatics like Trump and Putin around. I can understand the frustration but you negotiate, you discuss to solve problems. Just leaving, or, hiding behind borders or walls is just pathetic. It won't solve any problem ever. It's childishly naive to think otherwise.
0/-1/-1	So soft brexit is basically not leaving the EU at all
0/0	So sorry for all the British people who wanted to stay in the EU, it must be a miserable feeling tonight. As for the brexiteers.. don't let the door hit you on the way out! A very confused comment I know, but it's how I feel
0/1/0	So stupid to vote Brexit We need those migrants in our hospitals and other places. Those migrants helped out economy as well and now we have to let them go and people will charge much more for doing regular jobs.
0/0	So that's it; it's all over. I'm now no longer a citizen of the EU; I'm now just a resident of a small isolated island in the middle of the sea and I couldn't be more sad
0/-1	So that’s a good thing ??
0/1	So the Brexiteers have won and the UK has lost and now it is time to look forward to what will be coming. Due to the extended negotiating phase and the soft landing in the transitions phase, companies can relocate to the continent at an orderly pace. That is good news for those with stocks such as pensioners and bad news for those depending upon a job for their living. Not surprising, it is thanks to the old age pensioners that this is coming about, but who would have thought that they would be capable of so much selfishness.
0/-1	So the EU has goods the UK want to buy and the UK has money the EU want....hmmmm.  This is a real head scratcher.
0/0	So the EU has more to lose than a No Deal prepared UK. If our government are unable to negotiate a good deal with the EU in two years and with all the parliamentary infighting going on, I very much doubt that our government is able to be fully prepared for a No Deal exit by the end of March
1/1	So the EU now has the authority to install hard borders in other nations? (The EU decides whether ireland puts up a border or not?)
1	So the EU position is to try and make ex members follow its standards? Wasn't this kind of meddling what caused the whole mess in the first place.
0/0/0/0/0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
1/1	So the UK is sending 8.5 bil to the EU every year. Okay, good reason enough to leave it, end of discussion.
0/1	So the UK leaving the EU the second or Third most important EU member with a population of over 70 Million yet that could somehow make the EU better huh ????? It would take years if not decades to get over this setback assuming the EU doesn't collapse and let's be realistic there is not gonna be any new EU members if anything more members will leave over time
0/0	So the UK went from the 'sick man of Europe' to a very dynamic economy and has since the vote gone back to the sick man.... I would say the solution would be to stay in the EU.
1/-1	So the entire country vote on something and because the people who lost don't like the out come, they want to do it again? In that case, I want Liverpool FC to replay the games they dropped points in last season so we can be champions. Seems fair right?
0/0	So the fascists have won their coup in the UK, Farage and co. have got what they wanted
0/0	So the idiots in Westminster spend a whole day discussing and voting in favour of something that the EU are quite clear is unacceptable. All this time wasting while the clock ticks inexorably towards March 29th. The incompetence of this "strong and stable" government is incomprehensible. The best Brexit is no Brexit at all.
1/1	So the most voted for thing in British history should be halted? And that's not a war against democracy?
0/0	So the workers knew what they did when they voted leave and are ok with being laid off because of Brexit? Brilliant, the turkey voted for Christmas. Bizarre. They deserve to feel the steel of Brexit.
1/1	So they clap when it is mentioned the deal will not be renegotiated...Well clap a lot louder when we leave with no deal on the 29th March...Our clapping here in the UK will be heard over the waters and the fireworks here in the UK will light up the European skies. Bye Bye EU you set of theives, liars and dictators.
1/1/1	So they pledge to subvert a legal and democratic vote because they don't like it. Authoritarians come in many political flavors.
0/1	So they violated the rules with that “Brexit Macht Frei” pic, but both it and their account are still up
0/-1	So they've left? Even though they're still paying dues & following the rules for another year while working out a trade deal? How exactly is that leaving again?
0	So this basically means we're in all sorts of trouble. We have a PM using words like 'superhero' so that thick people can actually believe him. In modern Britain it is astonishing that people can be manipulated in this way.
0/0	So to get this right: Rich people will be able to migrate freely, but us normal people won't?
0/0	So today is Brexit day it is also my birthday so thanks for the birthday present you right wing fascist wankers
0/1	So trade sanctions that must punish British business for a British vote for independence & must punish European business so that nobody else in Europe will risk independence
0/0	So very tired of listening to pig-ignorant people talking pure bilge. They have absorbed the lies like sponges and do not attempt to seek truth. To add insult to injury, these are the folk that have decided our future. I could not be more filled with angst and anger.
0/0	So we are now officially prisoners on Brexshit Island. Thankfully there are no fireworks to rub it in and make the pain worse. A very sad day indeed.
1/1	So we have to do what the EU tells us, but the EU ignores anything we tell them. Just like old times really, which is why we are where we are.
1/1	So we lose a few quid and gain our sovereign control. Seems like a small price to pay to me.
1/1	So we should and vice versa, we are still part of Europe just not part of the failing union. Sooner we are shot of those bullies the better
0/0/0	So we'll be exposed to predatory monopolies, our market is going to be flooded with cheap products subsidised by foreign governments and we're going to scrap social protection and environmental standards. Yippee.
0/0	So weird , it’s like everything is topsy turvy with people actually celebrating leaving a union that brings countries closer together
1/1	So what's the problem? WTO is a deal. 29 March is getting closer, great!
1/1	So what’s the point of carrying this fiasco on leave. Spend the time teaching the MPs how to pass laws and look after our Country for a change. They are obviously so used to being told what to do by the EU its going to take a bit of time for them to know what to do.
0/0	So what’s whole point of leaving the EU if they have a lot of negotiation to do.
0/0	So when the British economy falls after March 29, 2019, will the Brexshiteers admit that Brexit is a mistake? Or are they going to blame brown people, the EU and George Soros for it?
0/0	So when will we start to reap the benefits of brexit? When will I earn more money? when will the things my taxes go towards be ran better? when will the NHS be funded effectively? Or is it just a new passport? and the opportunity to overfish the channel?
0/1	So where are all the comments from leave supporters....now this is becoming a reality and it is what they want they seem to have gone silent.... now that the reality is kicking in...bravo...you won. Enjoy your Victory
0/-1	So where are the UKs skilled workers? Why can’t these firms train those looking for work to do these jobs
1/1	So where’s everyone from?? And who will be attending any of the #probrexit rally’s in the lead up to and possibly after we should have left? Im contemplating Boston (where I used to live & the largest VOTE #LEAVE in uk) or travelling to London on 2nd Nov if we haven’t left.
1/1/1	So why should the UK as the worlds fifth largest economy be forced into freedom of movement, regulatory alignment, or fishery access?
0/0	So yea, we voted leave now where's that £350 Million/week for the NHS? Nowhere... The NHS is crumbling
0	So you think this is about Merkel?? Nobody cares about Merkel here. She may be the greatest administrator the world has ever seen, but that has nothing to do with the Brexit debate
0/0	So you voted to destroy the lives of countless millions and you expect us to site silently by and allow you to do it. Sorry love that is not going to happen. We will fight this insanity with everything we have
0/0	So you want to stay in the single market, stop immigration, fuck with the good Friday agreement, annnd not have to pay in for any of it? Yea... Totally a normal fair deal, and it's definitely the EU being unreasonable, not you being delusional.
1/1	So your backing a EU army, Germany and France today have moved close to this, we want a peaceful life open to the world not tired up in little EU
0/-1	So your suggesting we buy more fruit and veg from countries further away just because of leaving the EU, increasing our carbon foot print? Very Eco friendly.
1/1	So, Remainers, when do the drugs run out?
0/0	So, asking as an outsider, which policies were actually imposed onto Britain by EU with which people disagreed?
0/0/0	So, challenge of the day to our Brexiter friends. Give us an example of how the EU’s lack of democracy has disadvantaged the UK.
0/0	So, have fun being a vassal of the U.S.
1/1	So, it's all conjecture; all 'maybes' 'shoulds' and 'coulds'. No deal means we won't have an economic deal with the EU until we make one after March, that's not bad. Explain how, if it is!
0/0	So, just in the last 2 days he bans his aids from saying "No deal", tries to avoid any scrutiny from the press, and now he has a code for No Deal in order to discombobulate the masses again into thinking it’s not the dreaded "no deal" which would do trade no end of harm. What a lying deceitful charlatan winker
0/0	So, now that you can get rid of some of those pesky laws, who do you think will get to pick, the people or corporations? It won't be long before trickle down economics gets introduced. Good luck with that. When things get worse you'll see your first commercial prisons appear. Sounds familiar? Any society that 'hardens up' goes down a spiral of self destruction.
1/1	So, now the UK has the per capita GDP of Norway and the industrial power of China.
0/0	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There’s nothing wrong in that
0/0	So, rest assured--all of this Brexit crap is part of a grand strategy to destabilize and weaken Europe, the UK and the US and prop up North Korea, China and other anti-democratic nations around the world.
1/-1	So, the referendum has been fulfilled. We start with a blank sheet of paper. The battle starts again.
0/1	So, to sum up. There's a chance that it won't be as catastrophic as some sources say, but I don't know either so it might be a whole lot worse. Brilliant
0	So, we left the EU just 4 days ago and it's all falling apart. Promises made are being broken. Lies are being told. The fishermen, farmers, car manufacturers and UK businesses are being sold down the river. We don't need a deal they say. What a bunch of charlatans! #ToryBrexit
0/0	So, who wants to take bets on how long before Britain tries for re-admission back into the EU?
0/0	So, with Boris commanding Parliament, with nobody left to blame the situation he finds himself in, he cannot even muster a trade deal equivalent to Canada.
1/1	So, you really don't believe there are any reasons for leave? Why?
0/0	So, you say that Britain lost security and stability with Brexit. I am not sure that this is an opportunity for them It is not natural that Britain is not a part of European Union. This is just an attempt of showing the power.
1/1	So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You"Remoaners" along with"Traitor May" and the"BureaucRATS"in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should.
1/1	So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You"Remoaners" along with"Traitor May" and the"BureaucRATS"in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should.The only other alternative is follow the French and your own version of"Les Gilets Jaunes"
0/0	So. Vote leave have just complained about the EU building "bridges to nowhere " in "places like Scotland" . Well mate that "nowhere" is my home. Lost my vote on one. Bye !
1/1	Soft Brexit is for the liberal snowflake who needs the government to tell them what to think in their safe spaces.
0/0	Soft Brexit, Hard Brexit, Massive pile of S---. Sloppy Brexit, Messy Brexit, Quit, Quit, Quit.
1/1	Solidarity and opportunities. If you are a Geman/French bank, sure. If not, revenge and economic war.
0/0	Some Leave voters had voiced the opinion that they had only voted Leave to give the government a good kicking and they wished they had the opportunity to change their vote
0/-1	Some Remain voters have thrown in the towel, accepting what they see as inevitable
0/0	Some Uk Businesses are freaking out that there is a No Deal Brexit with EU
0/0	Some idiots are talking about leave.I swear they don't even know what European union is.They've no idea how imp is to remain in.#VoteRemain
0/0	Some lessons have to be learned through pain
0	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant.
0/0	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant. I was 17 during the referendum, therefore I could not vote. I am greatly effected by brexit. These pensioners had an infinitely louder voice in the referendum than me. The pensioners will hardly be around to even see the effects... thanks Cameron for ‘the greatest democratic process in British history’.
0/0	Some of us know who exploits us already. It isn't the EU.
1	Some of us remember life before the EU. We need to get out of it and stay out of it.
1/1/1	Some of you have lost the plot. We are still european. We dont need to be part of the EU project to be European.
0/0	Some people NEED to learn the hard way to eventually learn anything.
0/1	Some people actually voted for a man who just purposely waved a beautiful flag around in an insulting and childish way to annoy every other representative in that room at such an important moment of political history. That’s all I’m saying.
1/1	Some people are so retarted. This is great for Britain. Sure their economy is not great but it was already bad. Their economy will be great in the future as well. They also will not allow any Muslims into the country which was the main reason people voted to leave. A revolution is happening in the world and it has started in Britain. America will be next when we elect Trump as our next President!
0/0	Some people have been selling unicorns and fairy tales for 20 years. They have been telling people that all tough choices were made "Because Brussels told us so". So pretty much using it as the perfect scapegoat, even on matters where Brussels has nothing to say. For many, this was the ideal life as a politician, you can be popular, cause all the bad things happen, not because of me, but big bad EU... If I was in full control, I'd give you unicorns. But oh well, meanwhile I will fight for you with big angry Brussels. A position they could do up til now. My personal opinion is that they didn't want to win the referendum themselves. They just wanted a close remain vote, so they knew they were popular, but they didn't want to kill their perfect scapegoat. They certainly knew they couldn't produce any unicorns, which is why the second the campaign is over, they all ran away into obscurity, cause for sure they didn't want to show the people they lied to for years that actually the EU isn't all bad (not perfect). May is only doing what she could be doing. ANY deal that the EU is willing to make is worse than what they have. Read any of the Gym membership analogies... you cannot have club benefits from the EU without contribution. No deal is a leap in the abyss... You relied on central agencies and trade ties which were build up in the last 30 years, you cannot even begin to untangle them in 2 yrs, it will take decades. No Brexit is the only sane option, I think even the Boris and Nigels are hoping for at this point. If they remain, economically it would be the best solution for the UK, and they will become very popular again with all the people who voted leave and still think May didn't deliver the unicorns that these guys still claim exist.
0/0	Some people i know,(who i thought should know better) are going to vote Leave. Which makes me think,shit ,they really are more stupid ,than i thought.
1/1	Some people say that Reddit isn't all that liberal, but look at all the top comments and you'll see that it is overwhelmingly so. Also i will be voting to leave.
0/1	Some people think it’s the most significant thing for Britain since 1945
1/1	Some very uniformed opinions here ! I voted leave, like many others because the EU is nothing more than a self serving lefty club, very much as the GLC was for London. The final straw for many was merkel telling us, in no uncertain terms, that we were barred from attempting to stop their Kalergi Plan for all of Europe. Now is the time for all European nations to keep together to fight this abomination, the EU is anti European, if you doubt this look at their actions over the 10 years or so.......
1/1/0/1	Somebody explain to me how Switzerland deals with being in the middle of Europe without being part of the EU. Why can't that model be followed in Britain
0/0	Somebody please save Britain from this cacophony of gross incompetence that Brexit is.
0/-1	Somebody tell mrs sturgeon the scottish wanted to vote in the referendum to. If they couldnt accept maybe leaving the EU as an outcome.then why participate in the 2016 referendum. What a broken record this women is
0/-1	Somebody who is close to these matters said last night that Brussels were absolutely furious about May this week, regarding her behaviour as 'a supreme act of bad faith' . Bodes well for future talks...
0/0	Someone cut me up today and they had a Vote Leave sticker on their car. Coincidence? I think not
0/-1	Someone needs to give Theresa May's bucket of sand, the one she has her head firmly wedged into, a real good hard kick.
0/0	Someone said in this stream this morning that the leave voters are dying off, the Tory voters are dying off, and Brexit is dying off. I’m ashamed to admit that the first thing that went through my mind on reading this was "good, good, good".
0/0/1	Someone said that Britain is the first country to impose economic sanctions on itself. To quote from 'Game of Thrones vol1'- "The long summer is over, winter is coming".
0/0	Something I've learnt through this whole awful process is that I feel more European than British. We'll be back.
0/0	Something for all you brexiteers to remember, one of the greatest Prime Ministers this country ever had, Winston Churchill, called for a "United States of Europe" and while that is by no means what the EU is it was better than anything we have ever had before. Enjoy your special 50p Coins while you can, our currency is about to tank and become all but useless buying anything from abroad.
1/1	Something that I think it should be mentioned is the EU pushing the Euro, something the UK WILL HAVE TO ADOBT sooner or later should they stay in the EU. Note that the Euro is weaker than the Pound.
1/1	Something truly remarkable is going to happen.
0/0	Sometimes I wonder what bullshit UKIP is even feeding you Anglos for you to actually believe leaving is a great idea in the first place.
1/0	Sometimes a nation needs to secure it's society. Not up for WW3, gonna take a pass cousins. Best wishes
0/0	Sometimes an entire country, an entire people can make a mistake. This one from the British people is one of the dumbest actions in the history of humankind. There is absolutely no rational reason why those Brits did something like this. Perhaps this or that need had to be satisfied. But the bad far, way too far, outweigh the benifts. Still smh. Incredible.
1/1	Sometimes in life you need to take a risk.
0/0	Sometimes quitting may not be as easy as one thinks!
1/1	Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating – like the time I discovered, in 2013, that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.
1/1	Sometimes voting makes little difference to who governs you and how they do it. Vote Remain on Thursday and it NEVER will. #VoteLeave
1/-1	Sometimes you hear story’s about failure being rewarded well Germany is typical. They seem to have more clout than anybody so yes out
0/0	Soo many brexiteers out there, their minds need convincing/changing too..
0/0	Soon Britain won't even be a kingdom.
0/0	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of their problems.
0/0	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of there problems.
1/1	Soon the EU will collapse just like the USSR.
0/0	Soon, people who voted for BREXIT will realize how much more difficult they have made it for themselves and others.
1/1/1/1	Soon, very soon, they will be so glad they have left. All of them.
0/0/0	Sooner or later, they'll realize that they have set themselves in a dead-end...
1/0	Soooo let me get this right..Leavers voted for Brexit to make this country great again
0/0	Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of Britain crashing and burning.
1/1	Sorry I support the Brexit as I want to be ruled and governed by our own government and police force and not have a shadow government and police ruled by another nation as it is at moment. I also value the lives that was lost in WW1 and WW2 and will not disrespect them by letting those who they gave their lives for rule us. if you want to stay in Europe then may I suggest you move there and leave this country to the ones that want to make it work when we leave.
1/1	Sorry John Oliver, UK voted to leave.
1/1	Sorry about your personal problem, but I don't want to live in the USSR with better tailoring. The EU is a corrupt club for failed politicians. It is evil and soul destroying. I say this from an ex-communist state.The EU is the wrong road forever
0/0	Sorry but brexit is the worst idea anyone has ever had and if you've you voted for brexit then your claped
1/1	Sorry but most people's opinions in the UK is to leave most just want a hard Brexit
0/-1	Sorry but the numbers don't add up. Publish kingfisher documents so I can assess.
1/1	Sorry but there are two things that cannot be  changed in all of this and that is....The will of the people to leave the EU and the fact that Parliament is Sovereign...
0/0	Sorry for all my British friends today. I hope you’ll soon return too our flawed, but still quite okay European Union. Wish you best of luck in the coming months.
1/0	Sorry guys, you're delusional if you believe the EU will offer anything else.?
0/0	Sorry kids. You've been lied to by the LEAVEs. This is the way the rich elite and powerful keep the 'quiet ones' in line. The elite and rich who own papers like the DM have spun stories and spouted rhetoric that 'independence' is going to benefit you. But by leaving we give the elite more control and making them richer. We working classes will be worse off. Despite what they tell us. Immigrants pay more in tax than they claim. It's the rich and 'austerity' who are keeping it. Not people who are coming to our country because we voted to bomb them back in December. Wake up to the lies.
0/0	Sorry that the shitty bigots took over your country
0/1	Sorry! love the 48% xxx
1/1	Sorry, 52% of 'the people's vote' Voted to Brexit.
1/1	Sorry, no. I don’t want to give a single penny of taxpayer money to the EU whilst we have people here, living like this, tonight. If that means some of you have to forego a lettuce, get over it. Have to queue at Dover? Get over it. Lose phone roaming? Get over it. #brexitmeansbrexit
0/0	Sorry, the people did not vote for Boris Trump. He didn't get a majority of the votes.
1/1	Sorry, were you living here when we were an Independent Nation, trading with centuries old trading partners and living under our own laws and customs!!!!
1/1	Sorting the wheat from the chaff, get on with it. The moaners are holding us back, 56 days and OUT. Do it.
1/1	Sounds about right for the EU. Talking a load of crap.
1/1	Sounds like Channel 4 don't like the result of Brexit because they will lose the large amounts of money from the EU.
0/-1	Sounds like there’s a lot of tension in #UK Gov over budget spending plans.
1/1	Sovereignity, less unwanted immigration, not as many ridiculous laws, private deals and not having to pay the EU a membership fee.
0/0/0/0/1	Sovereignty is not just at the national level; that's the mistake of Brexit that other people make.
1/1	Sovereignty is the only argument necessary
1/1	Sovereignty!!!!! Before alleged wealth. Good for Britain!
1/1/1	Speaking as a Brexiter, if trade was the sole prism through which to view #Brexit, then from a GDP perspective there isn't a good reason to leave the EU. Let's stop pretending otherwise. Brexit is more than mere accountancy.
1/1	Speaks the champagne socialist of inner London
1/1	Specific examples would be the common agricultural policy which has seen food prices go up since we joined the EU in 1977 and honestly it has never gone back down.
0/0	Spot on. It will be a disasterous no deal Brexit come January next year if the UK government doesn't wake up to reality. The size of their majority will count for nothing when food and medicine shortages meet mass redundancies and petrol shortages. The run on the pound will only make taking on the euro seem so much more sensible when whoever's in charge finally asks the EU for readmittance.
0/-1	Stand United Europeans and keep enjoying the commonwealth
0/0	Stand back and enjoy the shitshow. Then lob a few hand grenades in here and there just to make yourself feel better. You're welcome.
1/-1	Stand up for Brexit

1/-1	Stand up to the evil EU GB in not a rule taker
1/1	Start as you mean to go on, time to take control back from the EU, what is the point in leaving if they still tell us what they think should happen, the reality has not yet got through to Brussels we stopped being a member of your very expensive boys club on Friday last
0/0	Start the petition to change the name from Great Britain to Little England.
0/0	Stay as always
1/0/1	Stay focussed brexiteers now is the dangerous time make sure it’s a real brexit not Brino
0/0/0	Stay in EU . Without EU wildlife and environmental laws the Conservatives would destroy everything that I love.
0/0	Stay in EU, then join human kind for the sake of the solutions of globalization.
0/0	Stay in European Union UK .
0/0	Stay in because I value freedom of travel and work higher than a very minute risk of terrorism and POSSIBLE net econonomic loss. I've been alive a long time and never had trouble with a "foreigner" as far as I can anecdotally tell most act on best behaviour until they integrate properly.
0/0/0	Stay in but needs change
1/1/1/1	Stay in the world, leave EU restrictions

0/0	Stay with the EU for the love of god. So much bad will come from leaving.
0/0	Stay, better for people, economy & environment
1/-1	Stayed up all night to watch this, then I slept like a baby after this great result! The remainiacs tears were very soothing :)
0/0	Staying In. Because I trust the EU Commission a lot more than I trust the Tory government. They would rip up any bank regulation within a week and see our consumer and worker rights fed to the wolves on a plate
1/1	Staying in EU is not an option.
0/0	Staying in the Customs Union is effective full membership of the EU. So fantastic - Brexit is cancelled. Brexiteers will go absolutely ape when they find out about this, but it will be fun watching them chasing their own tail.
0	Staying in the EU is clearly the most sensible thing to do.
1/-1	Staying in the EU is not in the interest of any nation of Europe but Britain seems to be the only one strong enough to decide it’s time to leave before we go crashing down with the rest of the member states and their vulnerable, weak Euro.
1/1	Staying in the EU would very likely lead to a long-term brain drain from the UK as non-EU graduates are treated as cash cows for the years of education they seek in the UK
0/0	Staying is the best possible deal we'll get
1/-1/-1	Staying without serious reform is also equally stupid. And the latter is not an option as the club has grown too big too quickly.
0/0	Stepping out of the EU is a step back in the reality of poverty. British fools.
0/0	Stereotypical Brexiter, "I don't want to explain just blindly believe me when I tell you what the truth is".

1/1	Stick ya offer of a new partnership. Let's get t f out of there while the going is good. Who wants to deal with that bunch of criminals anyway
1/1	Stiff upper lip Brits. At least you have your dignity and sovereignty. Things will bounce back. I get the feeling sometime soon after our own election.
0	Still European, always European # Brexit
0/0	Still Leavers get another 11 months where they can pretend that leaving is the same as staying but with nice blue passports and shiny new 50p pieces.
0/0	Still Zero plan or details on how they - and Northern Ireland - will trade with the EU, police immigration, etc. In effect, they've now actually jumped out of a plane without a parachute, with Boris saying he's confident that there'll be a solution to the issue before an undesirable cranial matter-ground interface with the rapidly approaching terra firma. All while that shifty fucker Farage dances around on the sidelines. Great.
0/-1	Still as stupid as ever then? How’s the Brexit family snowflake?
0/1	Still can’t believe Brexit is actually happening, and that the people of the UK willed it to be.
0/0	Still don’t understand why the wanted to leave the EU
1/1	Still glad I voted to leave. I wouldn't surrender the sovereignty of my country for anything. Those who want to overturn a democratic vote disgust me and make me more of an ardent Brexiteer as a result.
0/0	Still gutted to be isolating ourselves from countries where you don’t have to pay in a bar ‘til you leave AND you get tasty snacks for free.
1/1	Still have to laugh at the the tedious and odious remoaners on here who think they can reverse Brexit. You tried all the underhanded tactics you could and failed. You can burn your EU flags , as you won't be needing them again.
1/0/0	Still hoping that this is actually a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now
0/0	Still hoping that this is actually a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now 😥
0/0	Still no plan. The people who negotiated the deal from the government and who said this is the only way are now saying we can change it. Yet still don't know what to change it to. Brexiters are incredible....not in a good way
0/0/0/0	Still not heard one tangable benefit of us leaving. And I see that ' experts' are back in fashion again. It's all one big fat Tory con
0/0	Still nothing solved.
1/1	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests
1/1	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests. I'm hoping for economic integration and maybe a resumption of the free movement of people. But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
1/-1	Still the EU pushes ,still we push back. TERESA has gone,she wanted remain. Boris wants LEAVE. A deal will only work when BOTH parties are happy.
1/1/1	Still very optimistic about Brexit.
0/0	Still waiting for the Brexit plan from the Brexiters. Do we still hold all the cards, in this game of chess?
0/-1	Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU.
0/0	Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU. No one has actually managed to give any yet, all I seem to hear is some rhetoric, annecdotes and made up facts like "we get our government back from Germany" and other hilariously stupid comments

1/1	Still want to be part of the EU? This is our chance to break free and set our our rules and recapture of entrepreneurship. Come on! #GoBrexit
0/0	Stoopid Little England government has been dictating to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for years. We get it, you're the biggest and we accept you pay the lion's share of the bill. Sadly, that is not the case with Europe. Little England and its tax avoidance and paradise papers MPs who want to dictate are up againsy 27, yes T W E N T Y - S E V E N other countries. In the words of Rocky IV 'You will lose' and to think Theresa May, the weakest prime minister for years will cherry pick her way out of her own party's Brexit mess is pure fantasy. Dream on English Tory government, you will soon realise the empire and WW2 are long ago and the world is moving on without you. You shall dictate no more.

1/1	Stop messing about and get us out
1/0	Stop ruining Brexit propaganda with facts
1/1	Stop so many migrants coming in
0/0	Stop talking about how great you are, how great this is for Britain and how horrible the E.U. is. Just clear out your desk and go. We will figure out the rest at our leisure after you are gone. Then, after maybe 5 years or so and the dust has settled, we will see how things have worked out for you. And we WILL be listening to this speech of yours again to see how right or wrong you were.
1/0	Stop talking the country down, Simon. If only we were more optimistic we would succeed. (Am I doing it right)
1/1	Stop talking, we want hard brexit now!
1/0	Stop their inflated benefits which was a law from the EU! Once we are out, they should get less than the British People. It is disgusting what they get while we have worked and paid our taxes and for what? A bloody pittance!!!
0/0	Stop this Brexit nonsense
0/0	Stop this fucking Brexit now!!
0/0	Stop this fucking madness of Brexit,I won't stop immigration,the economy will crash
0/0/0	Stop this nonsense you call brexit.
1/-1	Stop treating us like morons who have no idea what we have voted for
1/0	Stop wasting time and money . Just leave the EU without a deal
1/0/-1	Stop with all the nastiness towards people who voted to leave and stop putting us all in the same bracket. Yes, there will have been unintellectual scummy people who voted to leave, but I am pretty sure that the same goes for those who voted to stay. We are not all unintellectual brain dead racist idiots so stop with the belittling snidey remarks and grow up.
0/0	Stp Brexit!! .‘The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.’Martin Luther King, Jr
0	Strange I turn it off because it is loaded with ignorant right wing leavers
1/-1	Strange how the sound mixer person turns up the volume when a leftwing Labour supporter generates applause.... but turns it down for the Tories… 🙄🤔
0/-1	Strange how we left EU and are now wanting to have the same trade deals as if we are still members. We have left, expect less. Johnson is trying to get back into the womb.
0/0	Strange, one of the reasons for Brexit was that they wanted more democracy. First they send they send the parlement and now they send the journalists home. Uk be on the lookout, these are dangerous times!
1/1	Strangers in Brussels calling the shots for your country was a insane system.
1/-1	Stress that we accept the following EU claims: that a free trade agreement comes with ‘friction’. That we are able to negotiate directly only with the commission (and therefore that EU member states must persuade the commission if they need particular areas of cooperation to continue)
0	Striking: Vote Leave Uses Same Tactics As Lobbyists Who #Deny Climate Change
1/1	Strong borders make strong nations. Good fences make good neighbours.
1/1	Stuff the EU where the sun don't shine. NONE of the withdrawal agreement is acceptable.
1/1	Stuff the EU, let's just deal with the individual nations of Europe and cut out those parasitic middle men.
1/1	Stupid ignorant and some totally selfish. Lets hope there is never a war because with people like this we are doomed. We voted out!!
0/0	Stupid uneducated people don’t know what is good for them. Brexit was a failure and they gonna pay for that. Idiots who voted for the brexit didn’t understand how bad it will impact the UK. The country is becoming so poor
1/1	Stupid woman, we're leaving on March 29th as per article 50, Brexit is already saved.
0/0	Stupidity and hubris win the day. Good look Britain. You are going to need a lot of it.
0/0/0	Stupidity at its height. Wait until food prices start to soar. What an absolutely assinine move.
0/0	Stupit Brexiteers wants to have a Brexit, so they have to deal with the consequences. You can’t have both.
0/0	Successive UK governments exploited whatever loophole they could find, pumping untreated sewage into our seas until 1998 – longer than any other European country. Now they've started again. #Brexit
1/1	Such a happy but also sad day. Britain is one of the greatest nations on this earth. After the US of course. Lol
0/0	Such a moronic waste - throwing away your country's position, power, and wealth for zero in return. The cunts behind it will have done a more successful job of destroying/weakening this country than a thousand "terrorist cells" could ever have fantisised of. "See it. Say it. Sorted".
0/0	Such a pathetic situation... when the drama ends and the dust clears we will see who's who, true identities will be revealed :D and yes UK will rejoin in one form or another IF there is still a European Union... after UK realises they cannot survive alone... so sad... it's just a lot of time that needs to pass, some things take time. The effects will be definitely detrimental for all of us.
1/1	Such a pity - it was a good idea when it was the Common Market. We’ve had co-operation between Europe’s countries for decades - Europol and Euratom long precede the EU, Concorde was up and running as an Anglo-French project long before anyone had heard of open borders or the single currency. The problem is that politicians always want more and more power, so having started something useful for helping trade, they turned it into a one-size-fits-all, single-currency bloc. Then they expressed surprise that political parties were formed in many member-countries to oppose that.
0/0	Such an idiota. You can know officially be an US colony. Enjoy.
1/1	Such awesome news for our beautiful Great Britain....back to being independent again
0/0	Such nonsense! Britons seems to be pure idiots (sorry to say)...
1/-1	Suck it up BBC haha.
1/1	Suggest you pull yourself together. Brexit is happening and your feels are not of interest or value in the discussion. Grow up.
1/1	Support of UK leaving EU from US.
0/0	Sure there's other non-EU countries to trade with (after all the USA is the UK's largest trade partner), but how they will perceive the UK after a Brexit in terms of reputation and renewed position in the world stage will remain to be seen.
1/1	Surely Europe shot itself in the foot when the UK joined it. Thank God (and the gullible voters) for Brexit!
1/-1	Surely if a Country has left we need 73.MEPs less ,maybe it was too long ago that I learnt my sums
0/0	Surely the best way to 'fight back' is to stay in the EU and stand our ground? We've run away. Hardly fighting.
0/0/0	Surely we should now all work to damage the UK’s economic prospects as much as possible and force it to re-apply for entry to the EU to save itself?
0/0	Surely you’re not still pretending that a glorious sunlit uplands brexit is possible. This dreadful deal of May’s is the best you’re going to get. If you don’t want it your only choice is #Remain
0/0	Suspect many of those are pensioners with their guaranteed triple lock, winter fuel allowances, free travel etc and are protected from the economic deprivations of hard Brexit.
1/1	Sweetsuccess, I'm educated and voted Brexit. If the vote had gone the other way, I would have respected it. I also know when my caps lock is on.
1/1	Switzerland and Norway are doing quite well without the E.U.  Britains have become jealous.  Will France or Italy be next?  When will the E.U. currency be equivalent to the Bolivar?
1/0/1	Switzerland is fine and it never joined the EU
1/1	Switzerland is not in the EU and is surrounded by 5 EU countries but has no hard border with any of them! Of course no deal isn’t perfect, no solution including a remain is! But food shortages... not going happen! Goods still move perfectly freely under #WTO with physical checks!
1/1	TBH since Britain voted out last June only good things have happend like the economy growing and unemployment going down. The only bad thing is the pound losing value but its not the end of the world.
1/1	TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE LEAVE!
1/-1	THE BBC ARE DIVERSIONARY PROPAGANDISTS AND THE TRUE ''FAKE NEWS'' POND-LIFE SCUM
1/1	THE DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. LEAVE MEANS LEAVE. GOODBYE EU.
1/1	THE GOVERNMENT IS RUNNING DOWN THE CLOCK ALL RIGHT, TO TRY AND EXTEND THE TIME. WE SHOULD JUST GET THE HELL OUT NOW, THE EU IS SO CORRUPT AND SHOWS ITSELF TO BE SO ALL THE TIME, THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN THE EU.
1/1	THE UK BETTER BREXIT OR FOREVER LOSE THEIR LIBERTY!
1/1	THEY WANT TO KEEP US TIED SO THEY CAN CONTINUE ASSET STRIPPING THE UK.
1/1	THIS IS A VICTORY FOR ALL US WHITE PEOPLE !
1/1	THIS IS IT, Freedom day from the EU. As said sometime back, we may have lost some battles Brexiteers, but we WOULD win the War. We can thank the despicable remoaner MPs with their obvious hate for Britain and Democracy that made Brexit most likely. The future is ours now
1/1	THIS IS OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK ITS NOW OR NEVER IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PARTY YOU SUPPORT THIS IS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY YOU ONLY HAVE TO VOTE CONSERVATIVES TO GET BREXIT DONE OR SPEND YEARS TRAPPED IN EUROPEAN UNION WE CAN TRADE GLOBALLY
1/1	THIS IS WHY WE LEFT AND WANT TO BE OUT COMPLETELY

1/1	Take back your sovereignty Britain! VOTE LEAVE
0/0	Take the cash for their constituents, and vote AGAINST her corruption.. Vote for Peoples Vote or to revoke Article50. Campaign to the constituents for Remaining in the EU. This isn't a game of deal or no deal. It's peoples' lives
1/1	Take your patriotism back Britain! Be your own country, not a linked state in a socialist aimed system!
0/0	Taking back control From Brussels and handing the control to Trump and Washington
0/0	Talk about shooting yourself on the foot
0/1	Talk to an American and money will become the subject, they have no concept of doing something for any other reason. Scotland and Northern Ireland have to choose and I guarantee when the chips are down and they realise the consequences of leaving the U.K. they'll come to their senses.
1/1	Talking about not leaving now? Just goes to show the people don't have a say or any power now..... Why should a small bunch of politicians over rule what the people of Britain have Voted for??? Let's not complicate things we voted out respect it do it! Otherwise you will lose the people as its a total slapIn there face !
1/1	Tally ho, Brits! Once again youse have shown the way to a world choking on collectivism, parochialism, arrogance and protected selfishness. For the second time since 1215 Britain has shown the world how to stand up and fight back.
0/-1	Tariff- and quota-free trade alone offers nothing for the service sectors
1/1	Tate & Lyle has warned its employees that EU membership suppresses wages and increases costs.
1/1	Taxation without representation didn't feel too good did it?
1/1	Tbh I wouldnt want any types of immigrants in my country. They usually bring problems with them that we then have to deal with. Tbh young people dont know as much as the old people about their country, thats a fact. I think that the voting age should be higher.
1/1	Tbh, I find the EU irritating. So the less influence it has, the better.
0	Teachers shouldn't be teaching kids politics. It's too open to abuse. They should be teaching them how to evaluate what they see and hear. How to see through the hype. How to identify truth amongst a barrage of fake news. Then and only then will they know what they're voting for!
1/1	Technology could take care of it, but he keeps turning it down. Other countries with borders with the EU don't have a problem. They want to hang on to us for our money that is obvious.
0/0	Technology, globalisation, austerity and many other factors have changed the landscape of the world we live in. Leaving the EU will not remedy these changes no matter what.
1/1	Tell Brussels to go fu-k them selfs and leave on WTO
1/1	Tell Tusk to Go-Away and mind his own business. We don't want to stay, or delay, or pay, or have much of anything to do with you greedy, arrogant, self appointed idiots. Just shut up and push-off.
0/0	Tell me. Why is membership of the EU preventing you from doing that?
1/1	Tell that Brussels house of Babel that you are no longer gonna sort the frogs from the fish. Same for schnitzel. And haggis if they're not careful.
1/1	Tell that to the French protesters, the Catalonians, the Basques, the Greeks, Spanish, Italians, Hungarian and Poles. The EU is not a union of equals. Germany dictates & all subservient states must follow or else face harsh consequences.
1/1	Teresa May did go to Oxford University when many fewer students actually qualified and has become the UK's only second female Prime Minister. I think she has quite a good grasp of what Brexit means!
1/1	Teresa May says that to have a no deal is sailing for uncharted waters. England has sailed in uncharted waters before and the result was the British empire. Roosevelt once said "The only to fear is fear itself" Please go for a no deal Brexit for heavens sake111
1/0	Terrible deal.
0/1	Terrible deal. No Brexiteer voted for this.
0/0	Terrible mistake .

0/1	Thank God I left in 1995. Hope Scotland get independence from these idiots.
1/1	Thank God for Brexit, Now it's time for Australia to follow their Mother of the British Commonwealth!
1/1	Thank God for Nigel Farage! At last someone who speaks sense, a voice for Freedom and Democracy. Sorry you were not very visible on national TV last night, there were more weather forecasts and remoaners lamenting Brexit than scenes of joy. This is a major historical/joyful occasion where our Democratic rights have FINALLY won through. The backdrop of a BBC newsroom surrounded by blue and yellow stars was appalling. The next step should be to change the stranglehold over our media and stamp out the negative propaganda and state run broadcasting machine. Give us some clean, clear facts we can see through the garbage. Thanks Nigel from the bottom on my heart.
1/1	Thank God for his one nation conservative government. Finally the Brits are free.
1/1/1	Thank God we have left, now we can fly our Great National Flag High and be proud.

1	Thank the Good Lord. Welcome home Britain to who you and your awesome people are. It's now time to get busy reclaiming your sovereignty for yours and your next generations. MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN !!!!
1/-1	Thank you Ambrose, for the clarity of your thoughts. You are right, as usual. We have stumbled out of the EU with a declining future, into the prospect of once again aligning with the US and the Commonwealth. We must never again look back like Lot's wife lest we find ourselves once again in peril. The future for us is with the Anglosphere. We must disentangle from the tentacles of the EU. Now is the time to do it.
1/1	Thank you Boris Johnson and your government. Our nation will over the long term be wealthier as an independent, free trading one.
1/1/1	Thank you God for Britain's freedom

1/1	Thank you for breaking away from that poisonous tit called the EU. You don’t need 150 people in Brussels to approve a butt plug. I’m proud of you.
0/0	Thank you for holding steady on the backstop. Quite a few UK MPs and citizens need an urgent history lesson, or to google Good Friday Agreement at the very least. My family in N Ireland do not want the return of the Troubles. Or brexit. Or any of this Tory madness. #Remain
0/0	Thank you for keeping the door open. So many are angry at the lies they were told and want to #stay in the EU. Nothing could be worse for the UK than #Brexit. I voted #Remain For my children and me. Please help, #StopBrexit

1/1	Thank you. Now please do not cede fishing.
1/1	Thank you.. it seemed like it was never going to happen this time last year, I nearly lost hope, we’ve finally got our vote respected.

1/1	Thanks 2 all #VoteLeave supporters @ #BBCDebate Thursday is the last chance 2 leave a centralising & anti-democratic EU & #TakeBackControl
1/1	Thanks America for the support and gongrats to America on getting your country back, I'm seeing on the news that they're saying England has left the EU. There' s 3 other countries within the UK WALES, SCOTLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND AND OF COURSE ENGLAND, SO PLEASE REMEMBER THERES OTHER LOVELY COUNTIES ALSO, PLUS WE IN WKAES VOTED OUT WITH ENGLAND) American good for you on you're new president elect, they're trying not to act article 50, the government didn't think we'd do it, in wales we Voted with England despite our differences, plus half of N Ireland. In Wales our steel industry for the first time has made a profit, so china can't import cheep Steele to Germany and then imported to the EU. Also Facebook is opening up on London, Obama threatened us that the UK would be the back of the queue, but Mr TRUMP will open up trade negotiations, I'm so glad American our cousins have always stayed together, we've got more in common with Americans and more alike with Americans than the EU. Plus our boarders will be now closed. All the best Loud, like Winston Churchill once said " IF BRITAN HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE OPEN WATERS, SHE SHOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE THE OPEN WATERS." We're not scared, they tried to ride the voting, but the numbers were so great they couldn't do it ✍️ screw the NWO 🖕

0/1/0	Thanks for making the U.S. look a little better in comparison. Idgits.
0/0	Thanks for that thoughtful post. One of the problems is that most of the British people that care about the advantages you have illustrated.... (Hundreds of thousands of them and myself included) ... were denied the right to vote in the referendum because we've been living within the EU but outside the UK for more than fifteen years. It was / is heartbreaking.
1/1	Thanks for the celebration Nigel. If it wasn't for him, we would never have got to celebrate our independence, we never would have left. Arise Sir Nigel. A true hero.
0/1	Thanks god they left
0/0/0	Thanks to brexiteers now we will be paying more for medicine Someone has to pay for whats coming.
0/0	Thanks to the media supported Tory propaganda, they will be blaming Labour, EU beaurecrats, and brown and Slavic people from the East for the results of them punching themselves in the face. Don't expect self-awareness or or even them realizing who really is screwing them.
0/0	Thanks to the real patriots who take the time to monitor, examine, challenge and communicate this hypocrisy. I still haven’t heard one reasoned fact from #Leave that portrays a single tangible benefit.
0/0	Thanks to whomever just woke the kids up letting off fireworks.Selfishly pissing off the many for the benefit of a few- seems a fitting Brexit celebration
0/0/0/0	Thanks you older generations for ruining the future of younger generations such as 16 year olds who weren't allowed to vote :) P.S. The older generations will die before they see the consequences of their leave vote. Also older people are more likely to be xenophobic and less tolerant of migrants so more likely to be manipulated by the leave campaign to leave. Saying "all immigrants will disappear" even thought immigration from outside the EU is more that immigration from in the EU and we've seen how hard immigration is to control.
1/-1	Thanks, but your a approval wasn't required. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ´ó §ó ¢ó ¥ó ®ó §ó ¿ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
1/1	Thankyou for respecting the vote and doing what the people wanted! Unlike some people who used delay tactics
0	That 'Mass Immigration' is about 1% of our total population, and doesn't account for emigration; Net immigration figures are currently around 335,000 a year, or just under a 0.5% population increase. For comparison, there were just under 700,000 live births in just England and Wales. factoring in deaths (cursory search was around 500,000 in 2010) you're looking at anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 added to the population each year just from births. So our population is growing by about 0.25% each year from births, and 0.5% from immigration, of which half is from outside the EU already. We aren't even increasing the budget for services by this amount in many areas, and they have been cut significantly in the past decade. Our services are stretched to the limit because our government lets companies shaft us financially, export their profit overseas without paying tax, and then tells us we all need to tighten our belts. Frankly, the last thing I want right now is those companies gaining untold influence over our future laws by making the Conservatives, or any of our current political parties, the ultimate power in our land.
0/0	That Brexit has now happened is almost certainly a direct consequence of that 2 years of populist intimidation. Brexit...
1/1	That EU membership money could be spent on the NHS
1/1	That Yarsley is an idiot, we already import from non EU countries so the UK is already set up for it.
1/-1	That has always been the problem,We stick by the rules Whie Germany fance and others laugh at us and do as they please. You are only scared of compertition if you are uncompetative.
0/0	That if it wasn't for the European resources the deprived areas of the North of England would not even have a library standing up !
1/1	That is exactly what we voted for Leave in its entirety, No Deals , or payments . Just honour the democratic voters
1/1	That is like asking why democracy is such a big deal, and why we don't just adopt a dictatorship because it's less effort. Sovereignty is crucial because it is the right of the people to control their own country. The more power the UK hands over to the EU the less say the people of the UK have over their own laws. If the EU wants a law and the UK people don't, why should the people be forced to follow a law they don't want? It comes down to who you think should be deciding the future of the UK, the citizens of the UK or EU politicians?
0/1/0	That is sad. The Scottish and North Irish deserve to be free. It is sad that they were deceived into remaining. Hopefully, they will wake up soon and get out while the door is still open.
1/1	That is so great ! Seeing Britons wave their flag a proudly as we in the USA wave ours ! Happy Independence Day UK !
0/1	That is the Britain that I used to know and love...
0/-1	That is why the UK, is denied the Right to Freedom of speech.We are silenced,and have to be mindful of what we say..
0/0	That many professional people in the government and so far Brexit its been a joke
0/0	That may be, but the English don't need to drag everyone else down with them
0/0	That might well be why the Leavers don’t like it. They all yearn to recreate those wonderful war years that they read about in comics when they were growing up.
0/0	That narrow 2016 decision cannot be frozen in time. The demographic changes are plain to see and the doubts in the views of 1 million leave voting Labour supporters would likely now translate into a larger Remain majority.
1/0	That was the first good step, next get the Muslims out, and the UK will be beautiful.
1/-1/0	That was true in the Brexit Bashes in pubs around the country too.
1/1	That will be the EU breaking in half soon.
0/0	That woman ,from Manchester is wrong,i live in North ,i am nowhere near been rich and i voted Remain because i am well educated now and understand the game.
0/0	That woukd be a very short sighted decision. Sure Britain makes a lot if products and had great trade influence but cutting ties with EU would mean some money glow would be redirected away from GB.
1/-1	That would be the sexy Brexit vampire that hangs around forever like an undead stalker, impermeable to reason!
1/0	That's a pretty extremist point of view, wouldn't it be better to try and improve the EU instead of leaving
1/1	That's absurd. You don't have to belong to the EU to have freedom of movement. There are these things called passports that work very well for Americans who travel across the globe.
1/-1	That's all ways been the problem with EU, they just donot understand our language.
1/1	That's bullshit. You don't get a redo when you lose a vote because you cried about it. That sets a ridiculous precedent where anybody can insist on a new vote on anything to "make sure the people haven't changed their minds".
1/1	That's fair. I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit, such as a more equal and international trade relationship with the world. But there is the possibility that I was wrong and things won't get better. If it doesn't go well I'll hold my hands up and say I overestimated the power of the UK, but I still genuinely believe we are large enough and influential enough for this to be the success that it could be
1/1	That's fake news about the British searching what's the Eu we all know what it is and over half of us hate it
1/1	That's fine, keep it up then we can leave with a no deal, then we can put in our bill for monies owed to us from investments. A win win, we save £39 billion as well as claiming the money the EU owe us and we are free of them.
1/1	That's good we just want to leave
1/1	That's great.... And hopefully Scotland soon will be able to do the same to the Union Jack.
0/1/0	That's it. Done. UK has left the EU team, running away like cowards from shaping the future of our continent. Self-centred, narrow-minded, xenophobic liars have won. And we have gained nothing. I am ashamed to be British. #LibDems #StopBrexit
0/0	That's one small step for Boris Johnson, one giant leap backward for Great Britain.
0/0	That's stupid as hell and since other EU countries start considering to leave now that GB is setting an example we're getting worried about the EU falling apart and war ensuing again.
0/1	That's the good thing about being independent i guess, you can leave an offer you don't like and try to trade elsewhere.
1/1	That's the point, the EU benefited from the membership of the UK. However, the UK gained nothing from membership of the EU.
1/1	That's the spirit Boris, give them the ultimatum this must come to a close, it's taking up to much of our precious 'road to recovery' time.
1/-1	That's the spirit. Make sure that they are equipped with some sort of mechanism to sink pirate ships. The French fish raiders can be very violent.
1/1	That's the spirit. The backstop is a terrible idea and will keep us under EU control forever
1/1	That's true freedom
1/1	That's what the eu amounts to, a bunch of plotters, sucking out everything good in sovereign countries.
1/1	That's what the people voted for, when will politicians listen to the people OUT means OUT.
1/1	That's why the smart thing to do is to leave and figure these things out later.
0/0	Thats all Brexit supporters are capable of lies and vile abuse, keep it up DM.
0/0	Thats it, i'm moving to the eu
0/0	Thats such a selfish move from Britain, which makes all eu countries suffer
0/0/0	Thats what happens when ...
1/1	Thats what happens when UNELECTED LEADERS who know nothing of the plight and condition of their people force upon them a union that lambast and spits upon their national heritage.
1/1	Thats why most people in the UK want out of the EU hell-hole.
1/1	That¿s right. If they don¿t want to negociate that is no deal then. Good luck to Germany to bail out everyone and pay our share. Our 39 billion could be invested in our agriculture and industries to be less dependent on other countries.
0/-1	That’ll show all those brexiteers who read the Guardian!!!
1/0	That’s it now I’m moving to bongo bongo land ... oh wait I’m already here
0/-1	That’s rubbish, it was a combination of their floundering and confused attempt
0/0	That’s the point. If you voted Brexit, you lost. If you voted Tory, you lost. Even if you’re rich, you lost. Because everyone else did.
0/0	That’s what I think of Brexit. It’s a terrible idea, executed badly and it will not end well unless it’s stopped.
0/0/0/0	That’s what happen when you let people without any economic knowledge vote in a referendum!
1	The "Brexit" referendum is a British domestic party politics manoeuvre and poorly conceived at that. It'll have far fewer consequences than most of the media
0/0	The "collective weight" of partnerships such as the EU made it easier to deal with global threats, so we should not leave.
0/0	The "leavers" lied about everything
1/1/1	The "people" who have been "invited" into Europe, by the globalists, are not the tolerant kind. The eussr politicians know this, but they are not aloud to say it. We all know this, and yet the great replacement is allowed to continue. Dark days ahead for Europe, the old continent. So good to be out - of the eussr, of course ... :)))
0/0	The #BRAINDRAIN starts now. People all over the country who have intelligence and talent will be plotting their escape to one of the EU27. Where will you go?
0/0	The #Brexiters have attacked the EU incessantly for 47 years . Now they have had their way, they can't expect pro-EU people to shut up just because #Brexiters ask for it especially when #Brexit is wrecking their jobs, their prospects, prosperity and their health. #FBPE
1	The #EU's architects never meant it to be a #democracy #EUref #Brexit #VoteLeave #TakeControl
1/-1/1	The #LabourParty of true democracy defenders like Benn Shore & Castle has gone. Labour's Eurosceptic heartlands are now told by the party's London elite NOT to vote Labour. You heard #AndrewAdonis vote for a genuine #ProBrexit party in the coming elections
0/0	The 'in' vote will win by a landslide. It won't even be close. Business's, agriculture, common sense dictates Britain stays in
1/1	The 'joke' is on the EU!
0/0	The 12 top together, which you cite, do not even make up to what Britain exports to the EU. I have 12 mice and one cat, guess who eats who. Furthermore, what do you have to offer to the world? Arms and weapons? Lethal injections? And when the other industries, currently in Britain, like the pharmaceutical industry will want to move to the continent do if London loses the EMA -- European Medicines Agency -- which is likely to move to Sweden, then you may have foreign buyers for what remains to export (like Royal mugs and other trivia) but there won't be much left to trade anyway. No matter how yo turn it, Brexit will make England (the part that will remain of the UK) much poorer, and a hard brexit will make it into a basket case (like it was before it joined the EEC in 1973).
0/0	The 2016 referendum was won through electoral crime. The government and Brexit MPs are, in effect, handling stolen goods and profiting from the proceeds of crime. They must be prosecuted and jailed and #Brexit must be stopped in order to return the UK to the rule of law.
0/1	The 28 countries of EU are way to different culturally, economically and socially. EU is dysfunctional - witness the euro crisis or the refugee crisis.
0/0	The 36% of leave voters who think that we'll suffer no negative consequences are like teenagers who think their allowance will continue ad infinitum, without considering where the money comes from.
0/1	The 37% of the people that voted to leave the EU are TWATS.
1/1/1	The 47 years we have been involved with the EU are only a drop in the ocean when we consider our long history; and to suggest that we are stepping into the unknown is defeatist nonsense. We are merely joining the other 160 odd countries who don't enjoy the' benefits' of EU membership
1/-1	The 5 million Brits who emigrated are free to speak English to their partners or family.
0/-1	The @BBC has become so devoid of impartial coverage of the news that it is at risk of becoming a threat to national
1/1	The BBC editors must be choking back tears, as their campaign to ignore democracy has failed...
0/0	The BBC has become as dumbed down as a brexiter.
0/1	The BBC have been told not to use the word BREXIT presumably to support the lie that we got it. Just watch....and you wondered how an entire nation could be fooled to enthusiastically back fascism in the 30s. That moment when the lie is so big, it couldn’t possibly be a lie...
1/-1	The BBC just can't stop themselves from being far left and pro-EU - a leopard never changes its spots - I refuse to watch any debates or news on the BBC these days as it isn't impartial.
1/1	The BIGGEST benefit is FREEDOM. No more having UNelected bureaucrats making decisions for which they never are held accountable.
0/0	The BRITs want to leave the EU and isolate themselves. What's next build wooden ships and colonize the world?

0/0	The Best thing for the is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
0/0	The Best thing for the 🇬🇧 is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
0/0	The Brexit Job Loss Index is an attempt to keep track of the number of jobs lost in the UK due to Brexit. Look which part of the UK has suffered the most already…
0/0	The Brexit Starzi. Be afraid..be very afraid. Unelected but trusted by an unstable liar of epic proportions to run the country.
0/0/0	The Brexit baboons will be a whooping! They are meant to be masters of their own destiny now not held hostage by the whims of any Johnny come-lately-Foreigner. No Unicorns, no cake and eat it, and now no friends, hmmm looks a lot like no future. Oh how their pyrrhic victory smells exactly like ... $h!†. Is this what Farage and Johnson promised?
1/1	The Brexit chickens can't stop clucking, let's get the hell out of the EU and show them how the great UK can stand alone.. Come on NO DEAL
0/-1	The Brexit debate has been a tyranny over British public life for last three-and-a-half years.
0/0	The Brexit govt admitted last week that Brexit cannot work. Even Mugg agreed that none of the options beside staying the the CU would work.
0/0	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad
0/0/0/0/0	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad, but somehow gets taken seriously in a national election.
0/0	The Brexit is a dumb idea. Dump the Tories.

0/0	The Brexit is tearing the UK apart!!
0/0	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault!
0/0	The Brexit vote has divided your UK for decades to come and has the potential to tear the UK apart
1/1	The Brexit vote must be respected for the sake of our democracy
0/0	The Brexit voters will realize they've made a terrible mistake when their pensions dry up.
0/0	The Brexit was the most foolish idea the U.K. has ever had. The U.K. should stop this madness called Brexit and stay in the E.U. Only Putin and Trump want a Brexit because they have their own agenda to devide the E.U.
0	The Brexit was/is the worst thing we have ever done. " The long walk back to sanity starts now." Indeed.
0/0	The Brexit will be meaningless and we’ll all have our nuts taxed off. He’s been on holiday longer than he’s been PM in this term but I’m already over him.
0/0	The Brexit would be a mistake because it would not help Great Britain (GB) with lowering regulation standards, would weaken GB's position in trade negotiations, and would overall be a net negative to GB's international trade. Exiting the European Union would not help Great Britain take back control of its own regulation. According to the Economist, "if a post-Brexit Britain wanted to retain full access to the single European market, it would almost certainly have to stick with most of the accompanying rules." That is a long term impact. Exiting the EU would not help in trade negotiations. Currently 45% of all of GB's exports go to EU states. By being included in the single market allows GB to avoid substantial tariffs. A London based think tank concluded that GB's trade is 55% higher because it participates in the single market. If GB exits the EU there will have to be a turbulent and messy renegotiation with GB's largest trading partner that can only result in a net negative trade outcome. I strongly agree with the British Prime Minister this will cost British individuals jobs, businesses will close or move to other states, and overall the financial security of British citizens will be put in peril.
0/0	The Brexiteer school of debating - keep shouting …
0/0	The Brexiteers just seem to want to wreck the economy, there is no coherent plan to their Brexit. Of course it wont be painful for them Johnson & Davis receiving £10s of 10000s from JCB Mogg & Redwood making sure their investments are safe in the EU Farage make £££s off crashing the £ & making sure HIS kids keep FOM Lawson taking up French residency Dyson escaping to SIngapore

0/0	The Brexiters and their politicians are the worse people in the UK. Scum floats to the top.
0/0	The Brexiters can't wait for empty shelves and rationing - it reminds them of the war.
0/0	The Brexiters wanted to take Britain back to the 'good old days' and looking at the drop of the value of the pound, looks like they've truly succeeded.
0/0	The Britain formerly known as Great. Brexit means poverty!
0/0	The Britain of pre-2016 will no longer exist after Brexit. We will mourn it as a new Nasty Party country is built on extremist Thatcherism. It will be impossible to have any affection for this new country and it’s inhuman values.
1/1/1	The British Empire is back.God Save the Queen
0/-1	The British Parliament is behaving like US Congress. US Congress more or less always opposes the President. But its by design, so the government usually functions the same. I think its unprecedented that a British Prime Minister is opposed by the Parliament for so long, yet wasn't removed. So its a shock to the British political culture.
0/0/0/0/0	The British are very arrogant.
1/0/-1	The British are well-known for their conservative values as well as the pride of who they are.
0/0	The British betrayed the European Union
0/0	The British betrayed the European Union to declare Scotland independence, joins the EU. I London. Let it be a city state that joins the European Union.
0/0	The British did a huge mistake.
0/0	The British don't care about a part of their own country, N Ireland. They're willing to sell out peace there for Brexit. Pathetic ignorance. Reap the whirlwind...
1/1	The British econemy would shrink really ? Maybe for ashort period of time, we import Billions more than we exportto the EU, only an idiot would dismiss the disasterous effect on other European countries if they did not trade with us.
0/1/-1	The British establishment hates anything which it doesn't have direct and total control over. Our membership of the EU - I mean full and proper membership - would make most of the draconian laws and "measures" taken by the tories and their nu-labour camp followers, illegal in Europe. In the same style as the dirty campaign waged against the SNP, truth is sacrificed for the sake of rabble-rousing. Come the day that Cameron and his owners ever do take our country out of the EU, we might as well all go and live in mud huts while serving our masters in the "grand house". The feudal system is alive and well and living here in Great Britain.
1/1	The British finally stood up against forced immigration and loss of their independence!! GO ENGLAND, screw the rest of the duck marching EU!!!
0/0	The British have a dirty secret and this secret shows the British don't respect human rights.Still secret the British Dr Mengele of human exploitation is still hiding
1/1/1/1	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
0/0	The British have never grown up, this is the stupidest decision a country has ever made in peacetime and which makes its own people poorer and the status of the country internationally completely insignificant.
0/0	The British moan about immigration, but the only thing holding hundreds of thousands of refugees stuck in the Pas de Calais France is the EU. UK leaves the EU and you'll be getting lots of new visitors arriving very shortly in Kent.
1/1	The British people DID vote for a no-deal Brexit and everyone knows it! Teresa May's refusal to deviate from her doom-laden path regarding Brexit in the wake of her resounding defeat proves that she has either been bought wholesale by Globalists, or that she is undoubtedly insane...
1	The British people are furious. We gave so much for our democracy and freedom
0/1/0	The British people are intelligent enough to learn from their mistakes, but the British government is not democratic enough to allow them to act upon what they have learned.
1/1	The British people are not made for the EU. The GOD designed them to rule the world.
1/0	The British people are very disgusted with the EU. These people think that the EU has brought too many frame frames to the UK, and the benefits to the UK are not many. The UK pays 10 billion pounds to the EU every year. For example, in 2014, it paid £18.7 billion, the tax rebate was 4.4 billion pounds, and the subsidy was 4.6 billion pounds, almost 100 million pounds.
1/1	The British people did the right thing! Move to "Europe" if you don't like the UK!!!
1/1	The British people don't want any deal we simply want to leave, I will never vote for a party that keeps us tied to the EU and hopefully 17.4 million others take mt lead
1/1	The British people have now achieved their ambition to leave the dysfunctional, corrupt, maladministration and undemocratic EU. That gives Britain freedom to take control of our borders, our finances and enable our elected Parliament to create our own laws. Britain has once again become a sovereign Nation. Phase one is now complete and trade negotiations begin. EU bureaucrats would be advised both sides are obliged to negotiate in ‘good faith’ but, remember the well quoted British mantra of ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ still prevails. With Britain carrying an annual trading deficit of £98 Billion with the EU. That puts Britain in the driving seat.
1/1	The British people have spoken and they said OUT
1/1	The British people voted Leave DESPITE all the lies of the Remain campaign. So it was very much a valid referendum.
1/1	The British people voted for BREXIT. Just do it! (Hard) There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream. If BREXIT helps crash the EU house of cards, even better; everybody gets their sovereignty back and globalism is defeated.
1/1	The British people voted to come out, let’s just get out !
1/1	The British people voted to leave your corrupt EU and that was to leave with no deals whatsoever.
0/0	The British people were told they were joining a common market that would help break down the bureaucratic barriers impeding trade across Europe - was there any mention of a European superstate?
1/1	The British people will VOTE LEAVE from the EU dictatorship and help free Europe and Europeans from it too :)

0/1	The British took a hasty decision.
0/0	The British took a hasty decision. Nothing stopped them to cut deals with other countries while inside the EU. Its immigration "problem" is not from EU but from UK's ex colonies.
0	The British voted to leave the EU based upon racism without thinking the issue through just as Americans out of racism, anger, fear, selfishness elected the unfit, illegitimate Trump as president.
1/0	The British will face karma for the history. :)
1/1	The British working class have been getting screwed for the past 50 yrs while the top end of town has got richer beyond belief. No side of politics has given a shit until brexit came along. It is the first time in 50 years their views have counted for something. Brexit is a wake up call that a change of direction is needed.
1/1	The British, like Americans, are like Dorothy with the ruby slippers. We can get back to Kansas. The answer is squeezing the Ruling Class by limiting their money, and reducing government, and it's bureaucracies, where ever they try to expand. Bigger government is not your friend. It is your Ruler.

1/1/-1	The Brits don't fit the eu's prissy rule bound attitude and their school perfect like club.
0/0	The Brits don't want immigrants so why don't they compromise? Leave all the agreements except the issue with visas and immigration. I think the Brits are finding out people in poorer EU nations can do their jobs, and more cheaply too.
1/0	The Brits have made the UK, great again.
1/1	The Brits have shown us that you can leave the European Union, and you can come out better.
0/0	The Brits like us Americans are fast becoming a new generation of fascists. I hope the EU will be able to withstand this rising tide of hate and self destruction.

1/1	The Conservative party will ensure that we fulfil our duty in ensuring that stability, so that we can all, as one country go forward together.
0/0	The Daily Express takes the opportunity to claim success for their campaign to leave the EU, telling readers: “Yes, we did it.” Indeed! for once they are telling the TRUTH!! without the lies and the odious anti immigrant anti EU propaganda which they have systematically used for decades we would not be where we are today, at the edge of a precipice! That also goes for the Sun and the Daily Mail. They can all congratulate themselves and each other for a job well done!! Now , readers of the most corrupt press in the West, ENJOY!!
0/1	The Danish Foreign minister compared the Brexit process as a Car Cash in slowmotion.
0/0	The Dutch aren't that bothered that much anymore I think. Business in particular has already moved on and there's a lot of talk about the opportunities Brexit creates (rather than the challenges). A lot of debate about the value or otherwise of immigration but almost no respect for how they might feel as human beings. Nobody will come out of this well.
1/1	The E U is failing...ask Italy or hungry or even Poland...
1/1	The E union was bad idea from day one
1/1	The E.U is nothing but totalitarianist bullies! We are leaving your concentration camp on the 29th of march!?
1/1	The E.U. is financially, politically & morally bankrupt. It's intentional ! When order has completely broken down in the E.U. then the U.N. will assume governance as planned. "N.W.O Phase 1 complete" ! Next ? The U.S. (The U.K. can still escape).
1/1	The E.U. needs to change its immigration laws, I think that's why a lot of English want out
1/1	The EU "provides the most hospitable ecosystem in the developed world for rentier monopoly corporations, tax-dodging elites and organized crime,"
1/1	The EU Brexit commission in Brussels today said & I quote "the UK leaving the EU without a deal will have the equivalent effect of 19 member states simply walking away tomorrow!"... Yet here we are the unelected EU dictatorship refusing to do a deal. Losing the 5th biggest economy in the world will hurt them far more than us!!
1/1	The EU Commission does not understand democracy.
1/1	The EU Is a dictatorship ran by Germans, who don't let any other country's have power. It's what hitter wanted, just in a more subtle way
1/1	The EU NEEDS the UK. It is the EU that needs to be trying to make a deal with the UK. The UK simply needs to leave and take back control of its own destiny.
0/0	The EU also funds innovation, which keeps our scence institutions at a world-class level.
0/0	The EU amplifies Britain's voice in global climate talks and helps us to stand up against polluters in other countries. #StrongerIn
0/0	The EU and the Euro, despite their faults and failings are going from strength to strength as Global Britain descends into the farce of a second rank failing state.
1/1	The EU are adrift, whilst us Brits head for safer waters.
0/0	The EU are consistent, they say what they mean and stick to it. The UK Government are also consistent if you include running around like headless chickens.
1/1	The EU are desperate and are not to be trusted. If they dictate to us we should just walk away.
1/-1	The EU are hypocrits . We should insist the EU signs up legally to adopt our rules.
1/1	The EU are now terrified of a resurgent UK with a vibrant economy, free to trade with the world, right on their doorstep.
1/1	The EU are pathetic. Full of threats and bullying tactics. Nice people. They don't learn. They clearly want a hard Brexit.
1/1	The EU are selling our fish to China. We need to cut out the EU middleman and ensure CI and UK fishermen are able to get their fish in to Chinese hands. Welsh welks are on sale in S. Korea. It has been discussed in a Fisheries debate in HoC. Check it out via Hansard. Gove talks of a "£1bn bonanza" post brexit.
1/1	The EU are taking all our jobs, fishing, steel, just two, did you know that the EU paid for ford transit factory to move to TURKEY more jobs gone, and other companies have gone all in the passed and now we are out they will pay for lots more to go over there. Now the EU want to kill Briton
1/1	The EU are utterly undemocratic and run by a dictatorial "bunker" mentatilty that refuses to countenance reform or a change of mindless ambition.
1/0/1	The EU are utterly undemocratic and run by a dictatorial "bunker" mentatilty that refuses to countenance reform or a change of mindless ambition. And, should you dare to disagree, then (except for France of course) you will be punished. The EU will do everything it can to punish the UK for leaving, and to dissuade others from following this path. Mean-spirited Dinosaurs the lot of em.
1/-1	The EU belongs to FIFA, and FIFA is a corrupt organisation.
1/1	The EU bothered me-EU migrants never did so long as they weren’t Roma or criminally minded.
1/1	The EU can go whistle, the more competitive we are, the better for us, and after the way they've treated us, I personally don't give two hoots how hard it is for them!
0/0	The EU can live without 39bn. Can the U.K. survive when no-one will trade with you because you can¿t be trusted?
1/1	The EU cannot imagine life without controlling us in some way. WE however can live without their interfering and bullying. We're out!
1/1	The EU delayed everthing so now they must face the cosequence WTO deal please
1/1	The EU demands too much and gives too little (from my perspective).
1/1	The EU deserve no deal. Bring it on.
1/1	The EU destroyed Britain's fishing industry, and now is the time and opportunity to rebuild it. We had one of the largest fishing fleets in the world before joining the repressive and restrictive EU.
1/0	The EU did very well prior to Britain's membership and will do very well without it. It is Britain that will suffer the most given that it has traditionally given the least but taken the most.
1/1	The EU does not have any Money. IT'S OUR MONEY
0/0	The EU doesn't need most of what goes on in London as far as I can see.
1/1	The EU doesn't really have any negotiating strength left. The UK is free to pursue their own trade agreements with individual countries in any fashion they prefer, as well as deny EU fisherman access to their waters.
1/0	The EU doesn't respect any of it's members individual views or opinions. All it wants or values is European conformity and control, and whatever it takes to do so.
1/1	The EU doesn’t understand the power of nationalism. It attempts to retain nationality as a cultural right. On the other hand, it deprives individual nations of the power to make many decisions.
1/1	The EU elite want to flood Europe with migrants! against this! against EU!
1/1	The EU flag revolts me. I feel the same way about the Nazi flag and the Soviet banner with hammer and sickle. All these flags proclaim tyranny.
0	The EU gives us freedoms and rights, Trade Unions do the same albeit at a lower or more local level, yet the British working man has been manipulated into opposing both, all that forelock tugging must eventually hurt.
1/1	The EU globalist's are trying to disove out nation to take over our sovierghenty to wipe out our rights
0/0/-1	The EU guarantees a floor standard. Take the floor away and what stops a race to the bottom?
1	The EU had virtually destroyed the UK. I can’t believe people are debating on what is obviously a corrupt and flawed political union geared to benefit career politicians once voted out of office!
1	The EU has a crack in the ship and I don't t want Britain on it when it starts to sink
1/1	The EU has a whole department who's sole job is to annoy the British.... after Brexit we can never be friends
1/1	The EU has admitted it wants more control and closer ties over it’s members. Hell its even mooting the idea of a EU army. No thanks.
1/1	The EU has already sown the seeds of its own demise by expanding too fast, and not even applying its own terms and conditions to new members - it all goes through with a wink and a nod.
1/1	The EU has always been an experiment from day one and there were concerns even from the point of before we entered that it wasn't necessarily the best deal for Britain at the time.
1/1	The EU has always operated a give and take policy We give They take
1/1	The EU has been sucking blood off UK for longer than necessary. No looking back. No deal. That’s it.
0/-1	The EU has been trashed over the last 10 years with the financial crisis and it survived. What threats does it face to make it break up?
1/1	The EU has caused us a lot of social issues here. The city I grew up in had acquired lots of negative cultures from EU citizens. Begging, homelessness, throwing the change down on the train floor so they could pick your pockets. They took over local bars and wouldnt employ anyone British, they set up illegal hotels next to houses where people had saved all their lives to buy. We noticed it, all of it. Im sorry Europe but some of your grifter citizens are responsible for the break up. Since Brexit vote, it has improved and its noticeable.
1/1	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave
1/1/1/1	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave. We might just do the same thing here in Texas.
1/-1	The EU has done a brilliant job of stuffing up and discrediting Brexit - and the population of the UK is too stupid to realise what is happening.
1/1	The EU has even ruined the charm of Malta with indiscriminate road building. Same goes for Madeira.
1/1	The EU has failed to do its job. GB will be absolutely fine after we leave
1/1/1	The EU has flawed with the implementation of a worrying amount of legislation
1/1	The EU has grown into a monster, an anti democratic monster capable of overthrowing governments against the will of the people, they have too much power, it's just wrong
1/1	The EU has just as much to loose as the UK the parasites in Brussels are determined to hang on to the English cash cow and that's all we are to them open borders must be fantastic for terrorists no border checks come and go when they like
1/1	The EU has never been “nice”. It is a trade and regulatory superpower that is used to getting its own way.The UK is now discovering what it means to be on the other side of the table.
1/1	The EU has only ever been interested in British money, nothing more. We are a cash cow.  That is why they have been wanting the extensions, and still are gearing towards trying to get this transition extended. Its about our contributions, our money. They need our contributions to continue as long as possible.  The difference now is, there won't be another extension. They have 11 months to work with us to get a deal sorted, or its WTO and Singapore on Thames. Personally, I'm in favor of leaving without a deal. It will deliver the absolute clean break we need.
0/0/0	The EU has prevented inter European war.
0/0	The EU has provided an environment in which the countries of Europe can co-operate and flourish without killing their populations on grounds of nationalism. There is NO greater argument in favour of union in Europe. NONE.
1/1	The EU has said NO to changes, thats the problem, all the debating in the commons is a waste of time Delaying brexit , this is another ploy by the remainers to keep the UK in the EU, this extension could go on and on for YEARS, the UK leaves on March 29th 2019
1/1/1	The EU has shown it's true colours. It's a power hungry monster with little regard for those it rules. Only a fool would yield any authority to it, which is why I don't like the idea of our fate being in the hands of our civil service.
0/0	The EU has taken on multinational giants like Microsoft, Samsung and Toshiba for unfair competition. The UK would not be able to do this alone.
1/1	The EU has taken, taken and taken again over the years. The can't grasp that things have changed and slow on the uptake.
0/0	The EU has to be strong and make the UK an example of it - with all this love going and whatever, let us remember the lies used by the Leave campaign.
0/-1	The EU has to be strong and make the UK an example of it - with all this love going and whatever, let us remember the lies used by the Leave campaign. The UK wants to leave, then there is a price to pay. The UK was in the EU with many opt-outs. The EU cannot let the UK now have many opt-ins.
1/1	The EU has to pay us billions in trade tariffs plus they dont get the 39 billion for that rotten deal RUN the clock down to a no deal.
1/1	The EU have been scamming us for decades, moving our manufacturing, collecting our import tariffs from around the world and pocketing it, building up Rotterdam whilst our ports disintegrate, tendering our defence out so Spain and others build our war ships. Tony Blair and his Liberal types are an embarrassing sell out for this country.
1/1	The EU have been soaking Britain of their wealth for decades. Now they will have the opportunity to take back control and establish their own destiny.
1/1	The EU have done nothing but try to bully the U.K. into submission.
1/1	The EU have gone through the three most destructive phases of Grief, that of Shock, Denial and Anger. They are now on the fourth: Guilt, or perhaps the fifth Sorrow and Depression but they will soon move onto the sixth that is Acceptance and begin to work towards a deal that allows them to keep the benefits of accessing their largest export market, the UK. But one should always remember that the EUs sense of loss is driven by the fact that they always got more out of the relationship than we did. What I do know is, we will never go back.
1/1	The EU have learned nothing from Brexit but our future is bright
1/1	The EU have no right to tell us how we should trade with non EU countries
1/1	The EU have said no renegotiations so i don't see any alternative to leaving with no deal.
1/1	The EU idea was hashed up by the NWO Kleptocrats (bankers & multinational corps - NOT their citizenry) for self serving benefits (some benefits did trickle down, but not enough & way too much collateral damage - especially in recent years). Glad to see Brits open their eyes for a change. This Vox post is heavily biased and almost completely wrong (w/regards to employment & trade, especially). The only thing this article got right is that the transition will be difficult. But, the UK is better for it.
1/1	The EU interpretation of a "level playing field" is for the UK to do what they tell us to do.
1/1/1	The EU is CANCER..
1/1	The EU is NOT a democracy
1/0	The EU is NOT a democracy. the EU parliament has no parliamentary roles. It is a fake. Unelected people run this state, and obviously do not represent the people of this area. The UK may be only the beginning of either a complete reform of the EU or its deconstruction.
1/1	The EU is a Dictatorship. Nigel F is an asshat but he wasn't kidding when he asked who they were, because most EU citizens don't have a fucking clue about who is making these laws and regs and have zero say on which ones effect their Country. I don't want to leave the EU, I want to see it collapse!
1	The EU is a George Soro's puppet. The plan is destroy the sovereignty of European countries and create a single and centralized government, so they can pass laws valid for all member countries without even having popular approval, which is already happening today, but on a smaller scale.
1/1	The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
1/1	The EU is a bigger threat to European civilization than Hitler and Stalin ever were. Hopefully one day the european masses will see this, and string the lot of them up in the streets.
1/1	The EU is a complete sham. It’s a criminal organisation that should be dismantled.
1/1	The EU is a conglomeration of unadulterated chaos.
1/0/0	The EU is a corporate government and leftists don't see it
1/1	The EU is a crumbling mess, a 50's solution.
1/-1	The EU is a democratic disgrace - laws are made by an unelected elite and its parliament is weak.
1/1	The EU is a dictatorship.who would not want to have more control over there own country.
1/1	The EU is a disgraceful organisation in my opinion. It has become far too large and complex. It is not just a threat to democracy its killed democracy.
1/1	The EU is a fascist organisation. We need to hold our nerve and Theresa must go.
1/1	The EU is a fundamentally corrupt organisation. Not so very different to FIFA. As a businessman, exporting product worldwide, I can assure you all that life outside the EU will improve our trading position, help our economy grow, secure our borders and put the G back into Great Britain.
1/-1	The EU is a good idea but not if it is a socialist country. Britain demands the right to vote them out and as for France, Va T’ en Macron!
1/1	The EU is a monster Ponzi scheme run by dictators in Brussels! Thank God we are leaving!
1/1/1	The EU is a road accident and the UK is now in a car passing by on the other side of the road watching but glad not to be involved.
0/0	The EU is a scapegoat, as are the immigrants. The UK's problems were caused by the 2008 financial crisis just like most other countries problems.
1/1	The EU is a scourge upon humanity. Disband it.
0/0	The EU is a single market in which no tariffs are imposed on imports and exports between member states.
1/1	The EU is a sinking ship, a giant bureaucracy set up to feed the bureaucrats whose only job is to prescribe ever more self-serving socialist policies to grow the bureaucracy, while remaining completely impotent on real critical issues like the migrant crisis
1/1	The EU is a sinking ship. It's a dying idea and Britain should get out now.
1/1	The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy.
1/1	The EU is a totalitarian, anti-democratic, anti-nationalist organization. It needs to be completely dissolved.
1/1	The EU is a tyrannical and discredited sham that has hijacked and imposed political union on half a billion people. Far from the promised land of milk and honey, in reality the EU has proved to be the shoehorn for forced and unwanted "ever closer union". The EU is a racket that continues to strangle the life out of Europe with its incompetence and constant crises. The EU must be destroyed
1/1	The EU is about to make the free internet history. See the new Copyright directive (Article 13 particularly.) Typical for this bureaucratic nightmare. The British were right to vote out.
1/1	The EU is all about a new world order, one world government. To all the native (white) people of the UK, embrace your new found sovereignty and take your country back. Starting by closing down the 3rd world Muslim immigrant flood gates and kicking out the ones that are already there. As for the affects on the economy, jobs, travel etc. you can figure out those problems as you move along. A country is suppose to be defined by its people not its borders. This is the first "small" step to halting the genocide of the white race and its culture by the "J" team.
1/1	The EU is already looking and sounding last century.
1/1	The EU is an "irresponsible guardian of democracy", why do you think we are having this referendum? Should Remain win, then Leaver's will continue to campaign, to highlight the idiocy of belonging to such an organisation. Vote Leave.
0/0	The EU is an increasingly important pillar of our security, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression.
1/1/1	The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
1/1	The EU is an undemocratic organisation. Therefore they have not accepted the result of the 2016 Referendum and still haven't accepted we are leaving. All this time they have been entertaining die hard Remainers like Tony Blair, Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis who have told them they can overturn Brexit. All the above and many others in the Cabinet are simply looking for the valued prize, a place in an institution which can keep them in wealth and luxury for the rest of their lives. Peter Mandelson and Neil Kinnock, both backing remain in the House of Lords are in the pay of the EU as long as they keep the flag flying. They are just two of many I am sure. The whole Club is rotten to the core.
1/1	The EU is an unelected dictatorship!
1/1	The EU is an utter disaster, best wishes to the UK getting free of that sick dying animal.
1/1	The EU is as bad as Democrats trying to take our guns
1/1	The EU is basically controlled by germany. Yep the germans finally conquered europe, and anyone that doesnt like it is a bad guy
1/1/1	The EU is behaving just like an obsessive, abusive, possessive partner who can't accept that their abused partner has left the relationship. We will no longer be dictated to, and any deal will be discussed as EQUALS, which is what we are now. If they don't like it, there are plenty more fish in the sea (and all the ones around our coastline will belong to OUR fishermen!
0/0	The EU is being scapegoated for British problems and the fallout of the banking crisis & the poor have bought it hook line & sinker. The tragedy is going to be that if we Leave the poor will be hit the hardest and disenfranchised even more. Britain is a mess.
1/1/1/1	The EU is collapsing anyways. Mind as well get out before it gets bad
1/1	The EU is collapsing before our very eyes! We are getting out just at the right time!
1/1	The EU is collapsing. If your house were collapsing where would you rather be - in or out?
1/1	The EU is collapsing. Italy is nearly bankrupt and we ain't paying the 39 billion so hard BREXIT it is. We all have computers and Amazon if things go Pete tong.
1/1	The EU is communist, not fascist.
0/1	The EU is corrupt and a disgusting gravy train, one since the Kinnochs Labour will never desert. Leaving plays to my sense of justice and honesty but would be silly given the bigger picture.
1/1	The EU is corrupt, it’s the Nazis all over again. Trying to take over the world using economic means rather than bombs. Do we really want to be part of a global fraternity that is so evil and corrupt.
1/1	The EU is corrupt, self-serving, and is certainly no friend of the UK
1/1	The EU is dangerous It is getting worse and they want an EU Army You may laugh now, but I hope you dont pay later The EU needs to go , and go *quickly*…
1/1	The EU is dead .. try watching YouTube or some other of the videos of the YellowVests right across France, not just Paris. Also Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium
0/0	The EU is doing exactly what it said it'd do. It's not its fault the Brexiters are clueless.
1/1	The EU is doomed.
1/1/1	The EU is dying the only answer is to disband it
1	The EU is enormously powerful.
0/-1	The EU is even helping Britain to stop Russia to protect British people from nerve agent attack. This is the truth.
1/1	The EU is every citizen's enemy and many don't realise just what the EU is or its plan.
1/1	The EU is expensive and corrupt.
1/1	The EU is failing politically and economically. It only works for Germany economically, but politically it is seeing the rise of extremism again because of mass youth unemployment and the hollowing out of the middle class. Thus it is a perfect time to leave before we have to bail out the corrupt Italian banks.
0/0	The EU is far better prepared than the English jokers. And I'd rather have no EU deal with the UK than a deal that undermines the EU, exactly the thing many Brexiters would want to do. It's easy to sort out a deal "ASAP", but that doesn't mean that'll result in a good deal.
1/1/1	The EU is far from perfect and there is a case for leaving it.
0/0	The EU is far too complex for Trump supporters to understand. If it can't be explained by a slogan on a hat they don't want to know about it.
1/1/1	The EU is finished anyway, so it's either get out now or wait until it all falls apart. Personally I think get out now is the better option.
1/1	The EU is full of crap.
1/1	The EU is garbage, congratulations from America.
0/1	The EU is going to fail
1/1	The EU is going to fail with in the next 10 years
1/1/1/1/1/1	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made.
1/1/1/1	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made. The sooner they get on with it, the better! Socialism and open borders destroys countries, it doesn't help them.
0/1	The EU is horrible, rather be poor than a slave to the E.U
1/1	The EU is in a terminal state and any country that wants to survive needs to get out now.
1/1	The EU is in meltdown mode. Time to save ourselves and our children before we go down with them. This is our one chance to be free again.VOTE LEAVE.
0/0	The EU is in the driving seat. Brits need to stop thinking they're the powerful empire they once was. They're not. Their empire was defeated long ago. They're nothing but an insignificant island nation that needs the EU more than the EU needs them
1/1	The EU is in the process of implementing World Socialism, even Communism
1/1/1	The EU is just a gravy train for the elite....a bureaucratic monster in a feeding frenzy. How any self respecting Brit can defend it is beyond me.
1/1	The EU is like one's divorced wife, who still wants to use one's car, dip into one's bank account, tell one who one can and cannot meet and so on. BoJo is correct for once, you have to be mad to accept such a deal, it's like being in the EU in all but name.
1/1	The EU is like the 'mob' in TV dramas like the Sopranos. It is always about the money.
1/1	The EU is like the emotionally abusive boyfriend that you can't leave but desperately want to. It treats you like c r a p, says you can't hang out with your other mates, steals all your money and intimidates you. Why on earth would you stay?
1/1	The EU is made up of small nations and nations that don't realize that they are small yet
1/1/0	The EU is no a democratic democracy. No more to be said.
1/1	The EU is no friend of the UK. If UK doesn't break away now, it will be much worse in a few years when they don't have any other choice.
1/1	The EU is no match for the might of the Commonwealth. We shall crush them!
0/0	The EU is not bluffing. The integrity of the Single Market is much, much more important than the losses of a no deal.
0/0	The EU is not falling apart, Young people WANT the EU, you can clearly see this in Brexit results, most Young people acually voted to remain and in some decades those Young people will be the majority. The EU can't find a common immigration policy or a tax policy for example because older people don't want them, but Young people do, but again, sooner those older people will not be there anymore, and Europe will be able to live as a country
1/1	The EU is not going anywhere. Nothing stopping us reapplying to join the EU in 40-50 years time when the impact of brexit can be properly evaluated. With real world facts... Remainers really are so shortsighted and selfish.
0/1	The EU is not the common market. It is the single market. Which means saying no to diversity, to national autonomy and independence.
1/1	The EU is not what it was when we joined and we voted to leave after 50 years of loyalty. Most of the world are not EU members and they are just fine, trust me when I say us Brits can handle it too.
1/1	The EU is nothing but a waste of taxpayers money. those bureaucrats have abused their position only to enrich themselves and their sponsors instead of looking out for european interests. im glad britain voted out and i hope the rest of will too
1/1	The EU is out dated.. Stale.. One sided and racist to its own... Time to go!!!
1/0	The EU is setting the Trap to keep you poor souls in, and may is going along with them. I hope there is an explosive demolition charge in the chunnel
1/1	The EU is strangling us. We don’t need life support from a foreign parliament or an isolated “single” market when there is a world of trade to tap into. We need to remove this tumour and recuperate.
1/1	The EU is structurally flawed and doomed. It was modeled on the Soviet system - and it is heading in the same direction (down). When you are aboard a sinking ship, the only sane thing to do is abandon ship. We could do so much with the £55 million a day we pay to the EU.
1/1	The EU is the beast rising out of the sea having seven heads with seven crowns upon their heads, the book of revelations speaks about it. You can not buy, sell, or trade without using their s system.
1/1	The EU is the fourth Reich.. Vote to leave now, sign the government petition..no 200165 Leave Now.
1/1	The EU is the new USSR
1/1	The EU is the past. 93+% of the world population live outside the EU and all the economic growth is outside the EU.
1/1	The EU is the prototype for the New World Order, in which democracy will cease to exist
1/1	The EU is titanic, it has already hit the iceberg. The UK are the first people into the lifeboats. We have rowed away and awaiting rescue. While the EU is rearranging the deck chairs in the dark.
0/0	The EU is well and alive. The UK is paralyzed, confused and scared.
1/1	The EU isn't doing as well as it used to and it's really down skewed economic reporting that suggests the eurozone is doing great.
1/0	The EU isn't perfect but working together is better than running off and sulking in the corner
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The EU isn't perfect but working together is better than running off and sulking in the corner.
1/-1	The EU isn't working that's a given
0/1	The EU isn't working that's a given But most people wanting to leave was because of Immigration But the Uk will get more immigrants from India than eastern Europe now So... it's not gonna satisfy people
1/1	The EU itself is a failed experiment of corruption and lies. It's failed to handle current and past issues and it continues to fail to democratically represent the citizens it preports to do so to.
1/1	The EU itself is losing global share. It policies have failed. The UK should be globally outlooking not an EU crumb hoover where we have no say. Anyone can see this political club is ridiculous.
1/1	The EU just can't stop giving examples of why it's such a good idea to leave.?
1/1	The EU just trying to get every last penny out of us until we leave
1/1/1/1	The EU just trying to get every last penny out of us until we leave.
1/-1	The EU legislation resulted in 95% of British beaches being safe to swim in. Nearly a year ago, in anticipation of Brexit.
1/1	The EU like the UN are globalist organisations with unelected members who only care about making evil corporations richer
0/-1	The EU market comprises 440mn consumers. The UK market has just 65mn. The EU market is six times larger than the UK market. The EU accounts for 47% of UK exports. If we want access to that market we will have to agree to align to EU standards. Take your pick.
1	The EU may be good for small countries or poor countries, but for the UK, I think the benefits we get are far less than the things we pay.
1/1	The EU may want and have 'Level' playing field. That's in their area. We in the UK are no longer playing for their side. We also have a level playing field... equipped with drainage for dealing with rediculous regulations, unbiased referee's (commissioners) and interference from UE courts. We have also rejoined the World league. We will be champions.
1/0/1	The EU must die in order that Europe may live. The richness, diversity, traditions and variety which is Europe must never succumb to an EU and its trajectory toward Ein Europa, Ein Volk und Ein Fuhrer.
0/0	The EU must feel like they are negotiating with a mentally disturbed child who spends most its time shouting incoherent nonsense to appease the derranged voices (aka leavers) in its head. How can you have a negotiation with someone who is completely detached from reality and lacking any self-awareness regarding their current predicament?

1/1	The EU need Brexit to fail, so the only viable approach is no further negotiations and Cliff Edge, to concentrate the EU's leaders minds, British troops should withdraw from NATO operations.
1/0	The EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU. This is a wonderful day for the world.
1/1	The EU needs The United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland because they know we are the best country in the world. We are & will always be part of Europe & can defend the continent & don't need the EU
1/1	The EU needs a drastic change of attitude if it wants a deal with Great Britain.
1/1	The EU needs a massive shake-up internally, as well as the added pressure supplied by an external source, and Brexit supplies both.
1	The EU needs the UK more then the UK needs the EU, we must not forget that.
1/1	The EU needs to DIE! They are just not getting the message. I live for the day there is no EU, and I hope I get the see all of their leaders hung on live TV!
0/0	The EU negotiates trade agreements with the rest of the world. Outside the EU Britain would have to renegotiate trade deals alone. While the EU is the world’s largest market, a UK outside the EU would not be a high priority for other counties to negotiate a trade deal.
1/0	The EU never needed the UK and it was only a member to avoid another war.
1/1	The EU only want our money, we have been mugged all these years.
1/1	The EU only wanted us for our money.
1/1	The EU or whatever it was called under it's previous trading names has never give Britain any respect since the off in 1973. Why on earth should it start now? The raison d'etre of the EU is to be anti- Anglo-Saxon. They hate Britain and they hate America. Simple as that. And there isn't a cat in hell's chance of a UK politician who will stand up up to them.
1/1	The EU over steps and forces the countries to take on laws that have been suicidal towards to people.
0/-1	The EU politicians are elected by proportional representation,which is more democratic than the UK system
0/0	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again
0/0	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again.
1/1	The EU provides no surprises. The UK should just withdraw.
1/1/1	The EU realised that we have escaped and are now desperately trying to handcuff us again. We are their prized pet or treasure island as we have become known in Brussels. Boris is having none of it.
1/1	The EU says no - the UK says no deal it is then. Finally we would get the clean break the UK needs to flourish without kowtowing to any more EU rules.
1/-1	The EU seemed to grasp No Deal was about to actually come.
1/1	The EU seems to be like a dictator. Just listen to that blonde lady scold the British for just waving their country's flag.
1/1	The EU seems to have had a very pro-internet censorship. So that is very worrisome. The less countries it has under it's wings the better.
1/1	The EU should be told it's a 100% hard brexit those beggars can support themselves. no more subsidies no more military defence no more tolerance of the parasites
1/1	The EU should break up a long time ago.
1/0	The EU should go hard on UK. It was a stupid decision, made by ignorant old people. And for crying out loud, why was it accepted? For such major decisions a 52% is not good enough
0/0/0/0	The EU should go hard on UK. It was a stupid decision, made by ignorant old people. And for crying out loud, why was it accepted? For such major decisions a 52% is not good enough.
0/0	The EU should place now VISAS for british people to cross to Europe and punish them with trade and companies sould leave the UK too leaving thousands jobless I would love to see it so now they can start looking for jobs in other countries and immigrating hahaha Karma and then be hunted and deported to the UK
0/0	The EU should stand firm and the UK Brexiters should suffer for their stupidity!
1/1	The EU should've stayed a trade union and not become a legislative one.
1/1	The EU show themselves for the borg that they are. Assimilating countries into it's collective, replacing their currency, overruling their legal system, imposing it's political will on the population. The line must be drawn here and no further!
1/1	The EU sounds like an ex girlfriend that keeps screaming “YOU NEED ME!” Might be a struggle at first, but it means freedom forever from a toxic, clingy relationship!
0/-1	The EU states sell a great deal to the UK - trade is a two way traffic.
1/1	The EU still thinks it has control over us. It's laughable!
0/0	The EU stop corporations from forcing them to work 60 hour weeks. Stop animal testing. Stop lethal chemicals from being tested off the coast for oil clean up. Stop the UK Government from selling off the NHS so fast. Stop corporations from putting a patent on seeds & genes in livestock like in USA so that Farmers can't collect a wage. They stopped the bill to get rid of Sick pay & Holiday entitlement. They limited the amount of overtime you can do. They stopped the use of anti-flammable blood anti-coagulants being used in daily products because they care about LIFE before profits. I will forever hate all those block-headed morons who voted to leave because this country is about to go down hill FAST. In just 5 years, everything will turn to shit. The corporations will own everything, Government will have no power, the Media will brainwash with forced ways of advertising, pensions will be gone, you'll have to PAY for a GP Appointment, for the NHS visits, deals with the USA will turn farms into factories (MONSATO), the price of produce will sky rocket, exports/imports will cost shed loads more because Canada, China, India, Australia etc are so far away (duh?) & we have forever locked out our neighbouring allies all because of all these dense people who reacted on pure HATRED without the benefit of intellect.
1/1	The EU unelected dictators have been trying to thwart the UK leaving from the begining.
1/1	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are off
1/1/1	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are orff
1/1	The EU wants to become a fully fledged federal government with direct control over all member countries basicly turning them into states rather than countries. I want no part of that, for this reason alone if another referendum happened I'd vote leave again.
1/1	The EU wants to end democracy in Europe. And when they do, the people of Europe will realise how vulnerable they really are.
1/1	The EU wants to make the UK suffer, they have no intent on being fair. If you have no choice but to stay, then what is the EU really. Not a democratic body, more of a gang.
1/1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!
1/1/1/1/1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
1/1	The EU was a good idea when it was about trade, turned bad when they decided to be social engineers and usher in 1984.
1/1	The EU was a terrible experiment
1/1	The EU was always about removing trade and industry from the British Isles, along with depleting our Armed forces. Now it is time to start rebuilding them back and make it that we import less from the EU. Past Governments have worked with the EU and now we need we need to reintroduce the a Treason act to stop that from taking place again.
1/1/1	The EU was made to help the banks make a profit by lending to them on account of the Euro. The British were very smart keeping the pound.
0/0	The EU was never meant to enslave the UK. Its goal was to prevent Europeans from fighting amongst one another, by stimulating internal trade. And it succeeded in that: it brought us prosperity and far less wars. Now the UK is gambling with both of these things, and there is a good chance that we will all find ourselves in the old, dangerous situation again. Are you guys happy now?
1/1/1	The EU was supposed to be nothing more than a group of countries joined together with the single purpose of trade & all 28 members have an equal say, with none more powerful than the other. It turned out to be a German dictatorship ruled with an ethic of fear & retribution along with a fully blown political land grab. Germany quite openly dictates to its members now "you do as we demand or else we will punish you!". That's a dictatorship in anyone's language!. Let's get gone.
1/0/1/1/1	The EU wasn't created until 1993. Britain got along just fine before and will do O.K. after.
1/1	The EU wetting their pants as we speak. That UK tail is seriously going to wag the dog when it comes to talking trade with the EU. It's going to be UK rules or no rules. Onward Brittania!
1/-1	The EU will be bankrupt once our payments cease. They desperately need our money and won't last without it.
1/0	The EU will be lucky if the UK gives them a few scraps to fight over.
1/1	The EU will be much better off when the Brits leave.
1/1	The EU will collapse soon. Thank God we voted Brexit.
1/1	The EU will collapse soon.Thank God we voted Brexit.
1/1	The EU will collapse very soon. Unchecked immigration and member dissatisfaction will ensure that. The UK saved itself.
0/-1	The EU will decide whether we will have a deal or not.
1/1	The EU will give much more If pressed properly, and rightfully so...if UK suffers, EU will suffer, and more. So go out there and tell them how it’s going to be.
1/1	The EU will learn that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The British hate the EU
1/1	The EU will negotiate in the event of a no deal Brexit. They will have to. Remainers are just lazy thinkers
1	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore
1/1	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore.
0/0	The EU will not start new negotiations. There are two choices left and one of them will happen, a new referendum or hard Brexit. If the UK holds a new referendum, then Brexit will die for the simple reason that more people have become aware of what the consequences are. If they choose a hard Brexit, it will bring economic hardship to the people of the UK, there is a whole lot more than just items costing more at stake. Think about this for a moment, Britain is far from self sufficient, it needs to import more than half of it's food sources. If you think this is bad, you haven't even seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Automotive industry in the UK is most foreign owned and those that are actually still owned by Britain use foreign auto parts, mostly from Germany. The Ford's Britain drive come from Germany. Farm machinery, foreign, drugs are imported from the EU, everything will become much more expensive. The EU will be economically hurt, but nowhere nearly as bad as the UK will.
0/1	The EU will not survive whether or not the UK leaves. Economic migration and the collapse of Schengen will be the death nell. The Euro collapse will be the final straw. Vote OUT.
1/1	The EU will now play with us yet again so he's got to be strong and tell these EU Muppets that he won't be pushed around like they did to Theresa May
1/1	The EU will pay for their arrogance against us Brits either give us what we want or the EU suffers when we become the European off shore tax heaven.?
0/-1/0	The EU will remain as the work in progress it is, but I am not that sure the UK will remain as is.
0/0	The EU will sink Johmson as theyy hold ALL the cards...Johnson holds Nothing EXCEPT the WTO threat and the threat of commiting suicide by crashing over the cliff. BREXITEERS.... WHAT IS THE POINT OF BREXIT?
1/1	The EU will soon be called the AU. Arab Union.
1	The EU will struggle more than the UK that’s a fact no matter what your agenda is.
1/1	The EU won't even be around then. Every nation wants out.
0/0	The EU won't even blink. We've always had it good with them because we were a member. Now we are a competitor they have no reason to give us anything. All this huff and puff from our governent won't make up for the fact that the EU have a much stronger hand than ours. Any short term damage done to their massive economy will be offset by their aim to take business from the UK.
1/1	The EU worked well up until 2002, when it consisted of rich, reputable first world countries.
1/1	The EU would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the UK. Of course it would. And we would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the EU and the restoration of a free Europe governed by its own people. It's coming. #Brexit is merely the first domino to fall. More will follow.
1/1	The EU's 'hard won victories' were not moral triumphs against an encroaching darkness but thirty years of deceit, manipulation, bullying, false terms. obfuscation, distortion and disguise. The EU is still seeking to create a federal Europe against the wishes of the people of Europe. Those who oppose these anti-democratic and totalitarian aims are not 'populists' but democrats. There. Fixed it for you.
1/1	The EU's agenda has always been the same. They want to rule us all.
0/0	The EU's job is to represent their members. Now we are in competition with them. Dont expect any favours.
1/1	The EU's refusal to remove the backstop should come as no surprise. We're dealing with fanatics who won't be happy until the whole of Europe is put under the yoke of a single government, and they hate the democratic decision of the British people. Let's ditch Brussels and go WTO!
1/1	The EU, a cabal of leftists-globalists unelected officials is suppressing the sovereignty of nations and caused havoc on the continent. It has outlived its purpose and must soon cease to exist.
1/1/1/1/1	The EU, in its current form, is unsustainable. It WILL collapse. Brits were smart to want out. But I fear the powers that be are desperate to hold their power.
0/0	The EU, or rather, Europe is an idea of unity and fraternity
1/1	The EU, should be illegal.
1/1	The EU, when looking for new trade deals will no longer be able to pi#p the UK market around the world to tempt customers.
1/1	The EU... is the enemy of the world.
1/1/1/1	The EUrines will continue to weep, threaten and sweat incessantly. Nothing new. Brexit will progress until fully completed. Thank goodness. Out means out and so be it.
1/1	The EZ is on the brink of recession. Considering the current costs to businesses for relocating at least part of their operations in the UK, it seems some would like to delay Brexit. It's the 29th March 2019, legally. Get on with it, deal or no deal.
0/1/0/0	The Economy of Britain will be 1£
1/1	The Electoral Commission is not trusted to be impartial and a number of its leading figures have said very prejudicial things about Brexit
1/1	The English and Welsh refused to bow down and cower before Brussels. Our ancestors would be proud!
0/0	The English clearly forgot why we came together as EU: War prevention! Also wrecking your own economy is not a smart move, that's shown by every economic analyst.
1/1	The Eu finance is going down quickly they will destroy us or try to
1/1/1	The Eu is a Trojan horse for the takeover. By his evilness Emperoe palpadean
1/1	The Eu is a criminal organisation , led by gangsters, banksters and psycopaths. Every country should leave it asap.
1/1	The Eu is essentially undemocratic and run by appointees who cannot be removed individually from office
1/1	The European Superstate will destroy accountability. The UK voted for freedom.
1/1	The European Union is OUT !
0/1	The European Union is a failed experiment, member countries refuse oversight or accountability for trade agreements
1/1	The European Union is a massive bureaucracy where the people do not even get to choose if or when politicians get elected. Britain is the first to realize this.
1/1/1	The European Union is a scam against the people. 🇬🇧GO BREXIT🇬🇧
1/1	The European Union is antidemocratic and the enemy of every nation state on this continent.  That is the only fact you require.
1/0	The European Union is finally rid of british congenital mediocrity : goodbye, bums, and never come back !
1/0	The European Union is in a desperate situation
0/0/0/1	The European Union is one of the worst ideas of all time and it should have stayed as a trading block. It is a bureaucratic nightmare and the sooner we get rid of it the better. However, we should have remained inside it and hoped for change, which probably would have happened it the end. Instead, we have put our whole economy at risk by being way to bold. The Eu is bad but it's not that bad.
1/0	The European Union is programmed to receive. You can checkout any time you like...but you can never leave.
1	The European Union is toxic
1/1	The European Union is toxic the United Kingdom did the right thing leaving that garbage tlnow they can have real independence and make their own laws and have a real border without having to ask EU what ot can do.
1/1	The European Union sucks, it's inefficient.
1/1	The European Union was a bad idea from the beginning. Great Britain did the sensible thing!
0/0/0	The European Union will always be stronger because different national growth rates in various countries will always compensate others, so that growth and stability is ensured. Britain is alone. Without many friends.
0/0	The European Union’s benefits outweigh its drawbacks
1/1	The European is starting to collapse, it will be them who will help from us and we'll be a better country with out them .
1/1	The European union has killed itself by expanding without the publics consent.
1/1	The Eurosceptic mission will not be over until the EU withers away. Brexit is just the first step
1/1	The Eurozone is one of the slowest growth blocs in the world. Sinking under a failing single currency, mass immigration, spiralling sovereign debt and a backward bureaucracy. The UK can be amazing free from the EU’s shackles
1/-1	The French tried that and look what they ended up with .If your British,proud to be British and want to stay British the only party to vote for is UKIP,they aint perfect but by the cringe they are damn sight better than the alternatives.
0/0	The GDP of the EU is bigger than the USA, and members get to trade in that enormous single market without restrictions on the movements of goods.
1/1	The German led EU project is the German 4th Reich in all but name.
1/1/0	The German machine will take over the EU when the EU collapses
0/0	The German word for it is "Fremdschämen"...basically feeling embarrassed for someone he isn't aware that he or she should feel ashamed for acting like an utter tool.
1/0	The Germans alone have systematically devastated our auto industry, in order to strengthen their own exports to the UK
1/1	The Guardian has become a left wing paper which is the conduit for sensationalism, innuendo and downright lies. Fit for lining cat litter trays and bird cages at best.
1/1	The Guardian is now a full blown, left wing, propagandist rag....
0/0	The Guardian should take their share of the blame. Instead of engaging with the actual concerns of the working class, you lectured them about how immigration is an unalloyed good and castigated them for being racists. Now look.
1/1	The IMF, Osborne, Carney etc are all basing their facts and figures on TODAY, not what it will be like in 2 years time when more of our businesses are enduced to mainland Europe to provide employment there, NHS costs have increased by 35%, not enough schools, power shortages, water shortages etc. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE we are only wanted for our money and assetts. VOTE LEAVE
1/1	The Independent continues to try and provide an echo chamber for dissolute remainers
0/0/0	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Brexit could cause a sharp drop in house prices.
1/1	The Irish border issue is basically the EU threatening terrorism. If the IRA want to kick off again, we, the British shall ask the yanks to get involved, with a huge military invasion of Ireland to start the war on terrorism !!
1/1	The Irish fishing industry was once a major employer all around our coast. And thanks to the EU our ability to maintain a viable fishing industry is uncertain. What a ridiculous prospect for an island nation. #Irexit should follow #Brexit
1/1	The Irish should leave the EU too, otherwise accept a hard border.
1/1	The Islamic immagrants are destroying the Europe. And the British people don't want that. So, Brexit is reasonable.
0/0	The LEAVE voters are stupid, stupid, STUPID people. Look what they did to the Pound Sterling. Never mind. Now they can live with their decision. From running huge chunks of the world to shrinking and being like Guernsey. Maybe that IS what they want. Sit at home drinking endless cups of tea.
0/0	The Leave campaign was based on lies
0/0	The Leave side talked absolutely rubbish last night they don't have a plan so what's the point of voting Leave we will be making a huge mistake so Vote to Remain in the EU.
0/1	The Leavers need to wake up from their Imperial daydreams
1/-1	The Left seems to have a new tactic where if they lose a Democratic vote, they immediately engage in a campaign of media saturation to demoralize and delegitimize the original choice and coax the public into sentiments of wanting the original choice to be ignored or undone.
0/0/1	The Liberal Democrats are strongly pro-EU, and have promised to stop what they call a "disastrous hard Brexit".
0/-1	The Lincoln audience is largely supportive of Gina Miller. Maybe Britain is majority #remainernow. People have changed minds perhaps, based on sensible assessment of risks of Brexit
1/1	The Lords’(heavily pro-Remain) #EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee concluded that“Article 50 allows the #UK to leave the EU without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under the EU budget”. That’s £39 Billion Saved.#Brexit #NoDeal #ProBrexit #HardBrexit #Leave
0/0	The MAJORITY will be HAPPY with a NO DEAL.
1/1	The Mad man did it. Now Britain will no longer suffer from the dysfunctional and undemocratic EU.
1/1	The Malthouse compromise or ‘sort of Brexit, better than no Brexit’ WILL NOT DO! It’s like ordering a Jaguar but having Reliant Robin delivered instead ...then having the dealer say “well it’s a sort of car... better than no Jag at all” ....it’s not what we ordered!
0/0	The May/Brexit Farce - a story without an ending. About as interesting as reading a large telephone directory or watching paint dry...
0/1	The Myth of Unlimited Immigration - anyone from any EU state can come and live in the UK. The Facts: European Union citizens do not have the absolute right to move to and live in the UK. They have the right to come to the UK in order to look for work, They have a right to live here without work only if they can show that are able to support themselves financially. British citizens have the same rights in Europe If you do not have work within six months, and you do not have private income, you can be asked to leave. The problem is that the government has no idea who is living in the UK. But EU law does allow registration of non-nationals. Any non-British EU citizens who stays longer than three months can simply be required by UK law to register with their local council. This is the law in Belgium. After six months they can be required to provide proof of work or private income, or be made to leave. The cost of setting up and administering such a system would be trivial in comparison with the costs of leaving the European Union. The lack of control is due to the UK government’s failure to make use of the existing rules.
0/1/1	The Netherlands is envious, wishing you the best, hope my country regains its souvereignty in the future as well.
0/0/0	The New Blue Passport looks Fecking Fan-tas-tic BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT #StopBrexit
1/-1	The Norway option could have been the best of both worlds in an increasingly turbulent future, and the moderate majority of both sides would have settled for that IMO.
0/1	The ONLY continent to grow less economically than EUROPE is......ANTARCTICA!!!!!!
1/1	The ONLY way we are going to get Brexit is to #LetsGoWTO these politicians are trying their best not to let us leave.

0/0	The Only Certainty when it comes to Brexit is, BREXIT IS A MESS!!!!
1/1	The PEOPLE ARE FULLY BACKING BORIS. WE WON THE WAR AGAINST THE EU , BUT WE STILL STAND WITH THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
1/1/1/1	The PEOPLE voted, brainwashed, uneducated, spineless europhiles need to stop weeping and gnashing their teeth and accept the DEMOCRATIC result

1/0	The Prime Minister says we need to come together post Brexit. Here is an example of this wonderful new world
0/-1	The Queen has signed the Withdrawal Agreement. The EU Commission and Council presidents have signed it. Now just requires the approval of the European Parliament in the vote at 6pm next Wednesday. Lib Dems will vote against but it will pass
1/1	The Queen wants us all to compromise with evil...to have a pragmatic approach to the Eu communist monolith. To accept serfdom and keep our chains for the benefit of socialist elitism - to not complain as the EU sucks all the wealth out of our country and hands it to communists like China! Yeah okay your Maj - cos that all sounds lovely. CIVIL WAR
1/1	The Remainer traitors are going to look very foolish a few years down the line.
1/1	The Remainers would rather put their trust in people like Hollande, Merkel and Juncker? That is unbelievable. If our government fails on Brexit, or anything else, we can replace them at the next GE.
1/0	The Remoaners will get used to it eventually but of course anything that may go wrong and cause a bit of an upset will always be the fault of brexiteers but hey ho thats life forty years getting into the quagmire of the EU forty or fifty to extricate ourselves from its tentecles !!!
0/0	The Right thing is to Remain. The intelligent thing to do is Remain. Lets vote Remain for our youngsters sake.
0/1	The Russians and USA support brexit to... divide and vonquer policy is at work
1/1	The Socialist Fascists in Brussels are no longer the boss of Britain.
1/1/1	The Socialists are getting scared. Revolutions are contagious!
1/1	The Society is divided because of a lack of respect by the losers of a legitimate democratic vote
0/0	The Sun obviously does not mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost because of Brexit, because that does not help their agenda. Nor does it talking of Sterling falling further, huge inflation and economic carnage and mayhem. All because of Brexit.
1/1	The Sun says remoaners should stop spewing their hate, what's this litany of garbage from Kavanaugh the American stooge then if not hate?
0/0	The Sun will probably continue screaming for Brexit even after this nonsensical economic suicide has been voted down by a considerable majority in a second referendum.
0/0	The Swedish populist, euro-skeptic and anti-immigrant party "Sweden Democrats" recently dropped their anti-EU stance because of Brexit. It simply became an untenable position to argue for a "Swexit" with everything that is going on in the UK. A few months before that the euro-skeptic socialist left party did the same thing. They are now talking about reforming it from within. It goes to show how insane the Brexit position has become, that the "allies" are seeing themselves forced to revise their position.
0	The Tories chose Austerity while handing tax cuts to the Wealthy. Theresa admits that money is available but withheld. Why would an MP who's constituents have been deliberately denied money by the Tories accept a bribe to keep a Tory Government in power?
1	The Tories have made a complete mess of Brexit negotiations.
1/1	The Tory & Labour party leaderships are totally under the control of the EU - so of course, they will do anything to prevent a genuine Brexit.
0	The Tory party is dead either way after this utter clown fiesta. The damage is done so I guess you'll be leaving.
1/1	The Tory’s have a lot to answer for, they have destroyed every day life as we know it, look what they have done, people are sleeping in doorways, people drinking in the streets, a lot of people can’t speak properly so they take to swearing all the time, they spout dirty foul language and it’s not just young people doing it, it is clear what is happening in today’s modern life, if that is what you call it, in seems like this country is going backwards instead of forwards, caused I feel by too many people in this country, yes it’s called over population, both the Tory’s and labour have severely damaged Britain, both have let immigration spiral out of control, vote to leave, i can’t see no other way out of this problem.
0/-1	The Turkeys voted for Christmas..
0/1	The U. S usually favors free trade. Even Trump favors Free trade, if he can get it. So tough it out, Britain, it looks like you're about to enter a brand new golden age.
1/1	The U.K. Have got the opportunity to turn the last 47 years to a distant memory, forward and onward.
1	The U.K. Needs to vote out of Eu spending too much in Europe and not spending enough like the Nhs also we need the border control back too many people coming in on a very small island
1/1	The U.K. as a £80 Billion trade deficit with the Eu. I believe the U.K. have got all the cards in this deal. Especially with a American quick trade deal before the end of the year. Plus deals with China / Canada/Japan/ Australia/New Zealand and on and on 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😎
1/1	The U.K. has just taken its full seat on the WTO today.... 👏👏👏👏👏 And it’s rightful place on the world stage. Now that didn’t take long.
1/1/1/1	The U.K. is just the first nation to leave the E.U., they will not be the last. The E.U. is on the verge of imploding and only fools deny it
0/0	The U.K. may not survive as a union, it may get even worse we could be heading for serious breakdown of law and order.
0/0	The U.K. should stop this nonsense called Brexit, because most of the people of the U.K. do not want a Brexit anymore
1/1/1	The U.K. should tell the EU what deal they want and give a dead line to reply. If the answer is not to our complete satisfaction we leave immediately on WTO rules.
0/0	The U.K. thinks leaving the EU is like leaving a fitness centre.
1/1	The U.S. market is far larger than the EU market anyway. Shouldn’t the U.K. be more concerned with negotiating a free trade agreement with a real friendly country?
0/0	The UE does not force immigration on the UK. It it a lie.
1/-1	The UK "might" end up worse off financially in 20 years than if we stayed in the EU
1/-1/0	The UK Government need to stop manipulating the vote with stolen data. Watch the Great Hack 👾👾👾 and see how they rigged the referendums and elections.

1/1	The UK and Germany have been propping up the EU for decades and the lazy, feckless and workshy countries have gone bankrupt and contributed noting except being a drain. on our economy.
0/0	The UK and its idiot citizens are going to plunge the world into another recession. Thanks assholes!
0/-1	The UK and the British (who let things happen or actively made things happen, depending on the way you look at it) are beyond help, and a lot of nasty things are going to happen there, all of which the majority of the population there will be extremely happy with, as it is precisely what they voted for. As said, beyond help, but even if that were not the case and help might still be possible, that help should NOT be given. The EU must stay out of it, even if only to make a point. One cannot help someone who doesn´t want toe be helped, and who is not willing to accept responsibility, someone who ALWAYS blames some other party for whatever happens. What the EU SHOULD urgently do, though, is take every possible precaution to safely protect itself from the UK and from what is happening there. We have come to long a way to allow ourselves to be thrown back into barbarous times, into quasi feudal situations, into situations from a past that should NEVER come back....Those times have long gone!
0/1	The UK and the EU have been integrated for four decades, so leaving the bloc was always going to be unpredictable and complicated, no matter how it happened. But these projections put the coming impact of Brexit into stark relief.
1/1	The UK bailed out its bankrupt banks remember. And with UK tax payers money. It's the UK that is the real spendaholic of the EU.
0/0	The UK benefits far more from the EU than the other way around so if they leave its better for the union in a economic way
1/1	The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
0/0	The UK can no long influence internal EU politics, nor can it influence EU-US relations. The direction of these two dynamics which have been vital for the UK maintaining its influence is now completely out of its control.
0/0	The UK can not break away from the EU. It can mess with the EU And break itself. Putin paid for both. So did the global mafia. #Brexit is a crime. Every current Tory MP is complicit. Meanwhile Nigel Farage rattles & the mafia controls the mass mood manipulation algorithms.
0/0	The UK can unilaterally stop Brexit. That's the best "deal" possible.
0/1	The UK cannot be expected to give up their future freedom and independence, To prop up the EU UK will thrive once the disruption settles
0/1	The UK colonist and occupied Iteland for centuries, treated them as 2nd degree civilians when they were poart of the UK? What did you expect? Gratitude? The GDP per capita is more than twice that of the UK in Ireland, thanks to the EU. They don't need the UK more than the EU. They think with there wallets and not nostalgia that's doenst fill the stomach.
0/0	The UK colonized half the world and now fear immigration...isn`t it ironic?
0	The UK deserves this. They had an election and an opportunity to prevent this. They didn’t care. They let the conservative old minority dictate policy for long after they’ll be gone.
1/1	The UK does not "Need" low-skill migrants pretty silly of you to state that as fact when you made so much effort to be fair during the rest of the video
1/1	The UK does not need to be in the EU to be successful. The UK was successful before the EU and will be after the EU.
1/1	The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe.
1/1	The UK doesn’t have a problem with Europe, just the EU, learn the difference
1/1	The UK economy could crash and I would still support No Deal.
1/1	The UK economy has been in managed decline ever since Margaret Thatcher was removed. Funnily enough just two years after John Major took control he signed the Maastricht Treaty which locked UK into the EU's scheme of "Ever Closer Union" and (he hoped) membership of the Euro. Extricating ourselves from the EU morass of stifling rules and can't do's can't come soon enough.
0/1	The UK government are a shambles.
0/0	The UK government could have controlled immigration more if they really wanted to without leaving the EU
0/0/0	The UK government have seriously underestimated just how difficult and protracted the trade negotiations are going to be. They really haven't got a clue and one can only assume they are either profoundly stupid people or preparing to fail and go for No Deal. Either way, Brexit is going to be a monumental failure.
1/0	The UK government plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on new infrastructure and investments in Scotland
1/1	The UK had hundreds of pieces of legislation from the EU. The EU is nothing more than a Dictatorship, leading us to world governance, world army and world policing. Research it yourselves. The New Workd Order and Satanism.
0	The UK has a very good deal with the EU at the moment and if we vote to leave we will never be able to get back to this point should we decide to re-join in the future. I personally believe the EU provides more pros then cons.
0/0	The UK has been as poisoned by the Murdoch's a America has. Extremely depressing...
1/-1	The UK has begun a movement that can’t be stopped
1/1	The UK has finally gotten their sovereignty back, the EU started out as a good deal, turned into a monster that ate away at the UK's freedoms.
0/0	The UK has lost its voice in Europe
0/0	The UK has major problems with its industries which brexit will not solve.
0/0	The UK has now become like a really aggressive panhandler outside a liquor store...one can only pity the delusions of grandeur and persecution that drove them to this sorry state... You can "ask" for whatever deal you want...Canada..Australia...Timbuctoo style deal ...you'll get what the EU decides is in its interest ....
1/1/-1	The UK has officially left the European Union after 47 years of membership. This historic moment happened at 23.00 GMT on 31st January 2020.
1/1/1/1	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
1/1	The UK has the entire non-European world to trade with. You have zero need of the EU for trade. None.
0/0/1	The UK has voted to leave the EU - a process that has come to be known as Brexit. Here is what is likely to happen next.
1/1	The UK has voted to leave......what would happen if you voted IN A GENERAL ELECTION FOR LABOUR.....BUT THE TORIES GOT IN......VOTE TIL YOU GOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT......RESPECT THE VOTERS DECITION.....
1/-1	The UK helped create these frameworks and isn’t being forced to do anything
0/0	The UK is a lost cause soon after leaving eu, to be a third world country run by snake oil salesmen.
1/1	The UK is afloat in a sea of leftist tears! Awesome! Makes me happy to see a nation set itself free!
1/1	The UK is already united. It's far better to be a sovereign middle power than have more protection as the subordinate part of a greater whole.
0/1	The UK is being HOLLOWED OUT. If you don't oppose it, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE.
0/0	The UK is floundering towards disaster without any effective opposition. Theresa May and her coterie of (un)-parliamentary allies has carte blanche to do what they want; Jeremy Corbyn will impotently heckle from the sidelines and be ignored. Unless? Well, that's the trouble. I can't think of a single 'unless'.
0/0	The UK is gonna get really poor now. Yes the North has been neglected but what happens when even London loses its source of wealth? How poor`s the North gonna become then?
1/1	The UK is in a great position to demand things as it’s such a net importer of many European goods Germany especially Does not want to loose that and if foreign goods become more expensive domestic companies can become more competitive and more money is retained within the economy enriching UK citizens more... this video is very biased
0/0	The UK is leaving the EU, then N. Ireland joins the Republic of Ireland and Scotland gets indepent joining the EU. This left England and Wales alone who are likely to collapse
1/1	The UK is leaving the single market, thus full control of immigration, under Boris Johnson, yes!
1/0	The UK is much better inside the EU than outside of it. Our membership actually brings a huge amounts of benefits to our country (https://youngeuropeansnetwork.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/what-are-the-bene…)
1/1	The UK is no longer under the thumb of the EU! Hopefully the rest of Europe follows and the EU falls!
0/0/0	The UK is now an international embarrassment. Ask for the Article 50 notification to be revoked and admit that #brexit was just undeliverable nonsense. Championing it as 'democracy' is just tosh. It was a desperate idea by David Cameron to get his party out of a hole.
0/0/1	The UK is now in more danger of becoming a vassal state of the EU than ever it was before.
1/1	The UK is one of the most interesting and profitable markets in the world....that is part of the problem for the UK....there are more foreign retailers and companies selling their wares than in any other EU country
0/0	The UK is only the fifth economic in the world, thanks to the EU and all their free trade agreements with other countries and the big common market within the EU. The all gone lose these advantages now.
1/-1	The UK is oppressed by the EU and has lost it sovereignty and self-determination to a bureaucracy located in Brussels.
0/0	The UK is rejecting and fighting democracy.
0/0/0	The UK is shooting itself in the face and taking the rest of us with them.
1/0	The UK is such a lil bi/tch and will pray and obey the EU like a lil bi/tch should. Hshaha
1/1	The UK is the 6th largest economy in the world and we import more than we export. People would be very keen to continue to do business with us not least the Germans who will be keen we keep buying all their high quality cars. There will be trade deals.
1/1	The UK is the second highest contributor of funds to the EU - apparently our exit will blow a £20 billion hole in their budget!
1/1	The UK isn't the same as many European countries. It's a lot more global and international. We should be making trade deals with emerging markets, like India. However, the European Commission has a very bad relationship with India and talks are almost frozen.
0/0	The UK just has a right wing problem and it seems like that the right wing ppl will win the debate. Leaving the EU is not like being able to join back later on but leaving that union forever.
1/1	The UK just needs to sign trade deals outside the EU to make Brussels play ball. Honestly, a clean break is the best thing that can happen.
1/1	The UK left the EU due to there suicidal immigration policys
0/0	The UK must be free from fascist brexit now.
1/1	The UK must leave NATO next.
0/0	The UK needs EU the uk cant stand on its own,if it thinks it can do business with the superpowers India,china,russia,usa, then it needs to re think because superpowers wont just give you business because they know uk is two faced
1/0	The UK needs to recognise that her economic and international fortune has always laid further afield overseas than just the Continent
0/0	The UK parliament will be sining that song next year when Scotland leaves the UK.
1/1	The UK passport is an expression of our independence and sovereignty, a document that symbolises our citizenship of a proud, great nation. Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world.
1	The UK pays 55 million a day in to the EU for what ? 75% of our powers have been given to them so we can’t make our own decisions. We did not vote to be in the EU and are entitled to one . Generations have fought and died in wars to keep it from foreign rule . The EU takes more from us then we get back
0/0	The UK people are going to starve of hunger, because of BreXIT - WATCH this space.
1/-1	The UK should do everything in its power to undermine and undercut the bloc. This will ensure its demise and once again our great nation will save Europe from tyranny.
0/0	The UK should get treated like any non-member nation by the EU. Similar to Russia, Ukraine, or Turkey. Trade should be on that basis. When you're out, you're out. Northern Ireland needs to choose to stay part of the UK or not. If not, and they don't want a wall between them and Ireland, then perhaps join the EU as an independent country. Scotland needs to decide the same and perhaps build a wall. Just get on with it. Hope you like Ale with Fish and Chips because French wine, Belgian chocolate, and Parmigiana are going to get scarce and expensive.
0/0	The UK should have stayed in the EU
1/1	The UK should leave the EU now the so called ‘reforms’ are a pathetic attemt at to fool the UK into staying for us then to realise we are diminished into a state on a larger united states of europe which i do not want an never will
1/1	The UK should leave... Don't Trust other random people to do your choices for you.
1/1/1	The UK should remember that their own roots are far better than those of the EU.
1/1	The UK should should not be held back by the EU as there are more opportunities beyond Europe. So much more potential within the Commonwealth countries alone.
0/0	The UK should stay in EU and build on it.
0/0/0/0	The UK should stay in the EU, regardless of what they think about it. It's just not worth it any more to leave.
1/1	The UK should stop exporting our music to the EU or charge them a tariff to listen to it. Then they can enjoy their shit Eurotrash music and all their gypsy Jazz.
1/1	The UK should use its new position post-brexit to implement a more sustainable position on fishing.
0/0	The UK still thinks they are an imperial powerhouse
0/0	The UK used to be one of the Rule Makers. Welcome to your future... A Rule Taker.
1/1	The UK wants be free by laws EU... Chuchill be proud...
0/0	The UK wants to have the butter and the money of the butter and the cow. It's not possible. The UK must know that the EU it's not only a market.
0/0	The UK wants to leave the EU so they can be free to make trade deals with the rest of the world, while simultaneously telling the rest of the world that any deal made will be reneged upon. The integrity of the UK has gone, who would want to be shackled to them?
1/1/1	The UK was always a Trojan horse for American interests and objected to any type of deep integration in the EU. Overall, this is a great day for the EU. This will lead to closer integration and better European institutions.
1/1	The UK was forced into the EU because kiddie fiddling Ted Heath was being blackmailed!! Ted Heath betrayed the British people because he couldn't keep 'it' in his trousers!
0/0	The UK was in the EU with many opt-outs. The EU cannot let the UK now have many opt-ins.
1/1	The UK was once incredibly powerful!! We don’t need anyone!!’
1/1/1	The UK was poorer after world war 2 fighting the Nazi dictatorship. We'll be poorer after fighting the EU dictatorship. For democracy it's worth the sacrifice.
0/0	The UK were given practically everything they asked for, but in the end found a union of equals an unpalatable concept.
0/0	The UK were never part of the Euro, so a lot of the arguments around economic sovereignty were not relative to Brexit. The leave vote will not be good for working people in the UK unfortunately, at least that's the way it's looking now (2018). It's looking like the UK has scored the biggest own goal (fuck-up) in it's history. UK needed to remain in and reform the EU. For all it's faults, (ALL mentioned on this excellent clip) the UK's position of influence and trading benefit from being members was a much better place than where it is now.
1/1	The UK will be okay the rest will die or leave the EU USA run cartel.
0/0	The UK will become less influential!!
0/0	The UK will dissolve because of this stupid decision, Scotland will join EU and not get dragged down with them, NI is lost and might even re-unite with the rest of Ireland, Whales is staying with England. What a step back in progress by you patriotic idiots.
0/0	The UK will do as it is told. The UK is negotiating from the weaker position.
1/1	The UK will finally be able to determine its own destiny instead of the Brussels "crew" imposing their immigration agenda on it.
0/0	The UK will have disastrous years to come.
0/1	The UK will have to compete one on one with every other country in the world.
0/-1	The UK will now need to negotiate many dozens of trade-deals in fairly short order. How many well-experienced and competent trade negotiators does the UK have? Not many, I suggest, since the UK has not negotiated any for decades - the experts in the EU did the negotiations. Good Luck!
1/1	The UK will now show the rest of Europe that it is much better to be a willing participant in a close partnership than to be shackled in an arranged marriage. Democracy and accountability will always prevail over dictatorship.
1/1	The UK will once again be an INDEPENDENT, DEMOCRATIC and Soveregin nation with a British Constitution & Rule of Law.
1/0/1	The UK will prosper if people want it to succeed. The only thing that will hold it back is continuously negative commentaries from disenchanted Remoaners.
1/1	The UK will sign new independent trade deals with individual EU nations and work out a free trade deal with the US that is currently going through an economic boom. Think about it, it isn't a head scratcher. It's all fine for the UK.
1/1	The UK will soon become the only wealthy western nation to be outside of a major continental common market where the big player sets the rules. Norway, Iceland and Switzerland all accept EU rules to be part of the big European single market whereas Canada accepts US trade standards to be part of the big North American single market. At one point the UK will be forced to choose between standards imposed by Brussels and standards imposed by Washington or risk losing its wealth and become a new Argentina.
0/-1	The UK's biggest blunder.
1/1	The UK's decision to leave the EU, was probably the best thing for the EU! Now they can focus on Continental Europe. and maybe even make the situation in Greece better! Besides, the UK won't last long as a nation anyway
0/0	The UK's future is to hang from the USA's coat tails and pick up the scraps the big boys have dropped.
0/0	The UK's going to get raked over the proverbial coals in treaty negotiations. Trade between Britain and the Continent will tank horrendously, particularly if Britain will exercise its newfound abilities to make inferior quality products. Britons will be losing the ability to travel through the European Free Movement zone as well, significantly hampering college/job/retirement options.
0/0	The UK's is going to colapse after this.
0/0	The UK...The only country to impose sanctions on itself.
0/0	The UK’s standards must be lowered if it’s to have any chance of competing. Brexit is one big standard-lowering exercise. Britain, the nation of no standards. It’s what the Brexiteers wanted.
0/0	The US and EU will steer the global economy and the UK can only watch on.
0/1	The US has fcuked many countries. Now its UK's turn. Britain bend over pls
0/0	The US is a country, the EU is not. There are many in the EU trying to move it more towards being a country and a lot of people in the UK don't want to be part of it. Personally I wouldn't mind too much and voted Remain but leavers want the EU to be a free trade group, not a nation.
0/-1	The US is going to be the biggest problem if we let there president into our Country on trade now we’ve left Brexit ,
0/1	The Uk is losing international respectability, the prime minister signs an agreement , which took two years of negotiations and then promptly gives two fingers to the other signatories ! Talk about infantile and untrustworthy !
1/1	The United Kingdom was great before the EU appeared, and it will continue being great after leaving the EU.
1/1/1	The Withdrawal Agreement has received Royal Assent and is now law. We will leave the EU on January 31st 🇬🇧
1/1	The Withdrawal Agreement is fair & non-negotiable.
0/-1	The absolute low point for me in more than 30 years of professional life was the Brexit vote.
0/0	The aim of Brexit is to divide the UK. And to a lesser extent divide Europe.
0/0	The aim of the UK, is to sit on their hands and do nothing, until the very last minute, while blaming the EU. We've been doing it already.
1/1	The air smells that much fresher this morning
0/0	The amount of leave voters who really don't know what they voted for is astonishing. Here's me actively hoping I can eat my words in the coming years
1/1/0	The amount of people I'm talking to who just want brexit to happen, no matter if they voted remain or leave is crazy. The EU has shown their true colours.
1/1	The anti democratic EU which has been built on lies, deception and trickery from the beginning is rotten to the core with c o r r u p tion.
1/1	The anti-Brexit morons don’t care if they give up they autonomy and freedom! They just want to suckle at the teat of unelected scumbag Bureaucrats!
1/1	The architect of Brexit was the European union. A trading block that now wants to be a federalist military union led by Germany. glad we are out!
1/1	The argument for leaving is not looking as scary as I first thought.
0/0	The argument that the EU should do what the UK asks because "they also would be harmed" brought us to the point we are at. The EU is negotiating on principles, not on convenience. The economic impact of Brexit is manageable for the EU and is nothing compared to the consequences of making exceptions to foundational principles.
0/-1	The argument to leave has always been flimsy, let’s revoke and retain control of our destiny and get in with the important things.
1/1	The arguments that the EU can do things better at scale have turned out not to be true. That is to say they are plausible on their face, but now we have 40 years of actual data and we have nothing but failure. Anyone who has looked at statistics for countries outside the EU or travelled outside the EU knows, knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the EU is not the cause of peace or prosperity. Most of the posters on /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics haven't even left education let alone done any serious travelling outside the EU. But it's not just stagnation it's genuine failure. The euro is the chief representative of that failure, but the incapacity to reform CAP is another, the incapacity to audit budgets, the slow pace of trade deals, the over-regulation, the incapacity to secure borders, the incapacity to accept democratic calls to "halt" on integration when treaties were voted down. These people are not only incompetent they have taken serious and drastic anti-democratic measures by passing treaties in re-written form which the French and Dutch voted against and not permitting them to vote again. That last fact alone, even for a pro-EU person, should be sending shivers down your spine. Some Communists, few but a brave few, saw through Stalinism, they saw that the utopian promises were not being delivered. It's high time some of the pro-EU people started seeing the catastrophe they have caused rather than calling for more integration like some commisar calling for yet another five year plan. You can't just lose a referendum vote and then re-write the exact same terms and pass a treaty without a vote. It's a disgrace. Millions of lives have been ruined across southern Europe by the euro poject, anyone who looks at the statistics or actually goes there can see. It is incredibly infuriating that this is not acknowledged in the UK because most people are so detached from it. Finally, on top of the undemocratic moves they make at the top of the project just look at how pro-EU people run /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics banning those who oppose them without providing any reason for having done so. The democratic character of the EU, from the top to the bottom, is completely rotten.
1/1	The article fails to discuss the constitutional position of Britains citizens. I want out because I don't want to give away my rights to self-determination, I don't want to sign over power of attorney to a corporate and political elite.
1/1	The asylum is the EU and the lunatic-in-chief is one Angela Merkel.
0/0	The backlash will come… You can fool people, you just can’t fool them all forever… 16.8million people weren’t fooled… it appears the rest of us will pay for the while our credulous fellow citizens learn the hard way…
1/1	The backstop is simply a devious way of tying the UK to EU trade law. However, both the UK and Irish governments have stated that in the event of a no deal Brexit they will NOT erect a hard border. The EU are scared stiff of competitively priced goods from the UK flowing into their Single Market but IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM, IT'S THEIRS! If they want a hard border let them erect one.
0/1	The banks will be celebrating the prospect of record profits from the UKs business and household debt from no deal. The golden age of bank profit from debts and loans is the only outcome from Johnson and the Tories.
0/0	The barriers should be coming down, not coming up
1/-1/1	The bbc missed the part where they have been calling white working class brits racist and anything about our culture as toxic
1/1	The beginning of a glorious new chapter in British history.
0/0	The beginning of more cuts for the poor and the destruction of the NHS. The UK had the chance to get a fair society for all and chose Tory fuckery. They threw themselves under a bus.
1/1/1	The beginning of the end ... the eu tried everything to prevent brexit... the euro was a mistake.. the eu also for gb was a mistake..bye bye
0/0	The beginning of the end of Brexit.
0/0	The beginning of the end of a UNITED Kingdom. Scotland will (re)join and Irland will become stronger and more influential.
0/1/1	The beginning of the end of the eu
1/1	The beginning of the end, for the EU. Rule Britannia!
0/0	The beginning of the end, so sad. I hope I am wrong but I do think that many people do not understand how much mess we are still in and when did we lose our sovereignty... it’s a nonsense. We do most of our trade with the EU our product will not sell there if they do not conform to their standards. Now we have no say in what those standards will be..... madness.
0/0	The benefits in trade and human rights are much greater
0/0	The best Brexit deal is no Brexit
0	The best Brexit of all would have been, no Brexit at all. I hope Johnson fails as he realises that being a PM is a job and not a game of truth or dare.
1/0/0/0/0	The best Brexit of all, is no Brexit at all.
0/0	The best alternative for all, even Leave voters: cancel the stupidity that is Brexit
1/1	The best argument for leaving the EU is visualising what it will look like if it survives the next 50 years.
0/0/0	The best deal is stopping Brexit.
0/0	The best deal is the one we have now. Remain with EU.
0/0	The best deal is with EU.
1/-1	The best deal: no deal with the eussr ... :)))
1	The best is yet to come!!
1/1	The best news today.
0/-1	The best solution is if England also leaves the UK.
1/1	The best thing Britain has done is leave the EU, should never of joined in the first place. You just wait and see.
1/1	The best thing Britan can do is leave the EU dictatorship.
1/-1/1	The best thing about #Brexit .... Europe will be a bully-free continent...Let's hope they ban the gambling torturing war games called premier league too...
0/0	The best thing is for MPs to admit that the main problems in the UK are entirely due to successive UK Governments and nothing whatsoever to do with the EU. MPs should have the courage therefore to vote to remain in the EU.
1/1	The best thing that has happened to this country since I been alive any way Long live the commonwealth
1/1	The best thing the UK has done is voted to LEAVE this corrupt EU and may all the European countries do the same only then Europe will grow stronger and all the peoples take back their countrie and power and unite and take back control from their servants..
0	The big promises, and blah, blah, blah are now over. Britain needs more than big words. So from next week, Brits should expect action. If it doesn't happen, you'll know you've all been tricked. Tricked by big words and bigger promises.
1/-1	The big question is what´s going to happen to the EU. Will the future be something like the last eight years dismal performance
0/1	The biggest lie of this whole Brexit saga is that those who want to leave are 'racist' or 'xenophobic'. There is nothing wrong with wanting a controlled immigration system.
0/0	The biggest mistake we have ever made.
0/0	The biggest problem I think is nobody seems to know what a post leave EU would be like.
0	The biggest problem with Brexit is that it rides on the Conservative wagon.
1/-1	The biggest problem with most of the MP's, they do not know how the EU operate and what their rules say with regard to any country leaving. The EU cannot negotiate with a member country while still in the EU. Therefore we the UK have to be outside the EU before they will negotiate with the UK. The only way we can have meaningful negotiations with the EU is to leave on WTO conditions or at least indicate we are prepared to do so on the 29th March 2019. All the nonsense spoken by Barry Gardener re -poverty and homelessness etc has nothing to do with the UK leaving the EU as they are all internal issues to the UK. The only way for the Labour manifesto to get any traction we have to leave on WTO terms. Caroline Lucas advocated that the vast majority of young voters were for remain -- various studies have shown that when asked most young voters were indoctrinated by their College/ Uni. lecturers in EU propaganda and actively discouraged from finding out about the leave campaign.
0/0	The biggest threat to our civilization is not evil people doing evil things but good people doing nothing. A lesson much of the West might be learning too late. Again.
1/1	The biggest threat to western civilization is not China, Russia or Islam. The biggest threat is most of the Democratic Party and the entire European Union.
0/0/0	The biggest weakness of the case for Brexit is that it is full of imponderables and uncertainties, with no sure benefits to show for the huge disruption it would cause for the years immediately afterwards. As far as I'm concerned the case for staying in a reformed EU is the only realistic way forward. I shall be voting "In".
0/0	The biggest worry is not so much leaving the EU. Its what would follow and I don't mean isolation I mean jumping even more in with the US and its TTIP trade games in which corporations rule. The UK political class have showed time and again how willing they are to give in to the US demands. The EU is not to be entirely trusted maybe but the US is on a road of clear decline, its congress controlled by narrow business lobbies and its democratic process largely bought and paid for. Its foreign policy ruled by its right wing obsessions. This is the really worrying scenario for the UK in particular.
0/0	The bigoted thick racists won, doesn’t say much for the losers does it.
0/0	The blame for even holding a Brexit referendum lies squarely at the feet of David Cameron.
1/1	The blood supply to the cancer that is eating British society has been cut, now you need to work on the tumor.
0/0	The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
1/0	The bosses love foreign workers. They are non-union, cheap and pliable. The British people who used to do those jobs have not gone on to university, they have gone on the dole or worse. There is also an issue over the conditions that the foreign workers have to endure, and the housing situation in the UK is abysmal. Elite media types and people like Bob Geldof have failed to understand the concerns of normal people. They look down on us and call us racist, but they are the ones guilty of bigotry. Britain became a socialist country after the second world war through the sacrifices of ordinary people. A welfare state was their reward. Now to be poor is a sin and you are attacked from every direction, so there was an element of a “stuff you” protest vote. The EU sacrificed cohesion for expansion that seems to be run by Germany. Angela Merkel decided to allow 1 million migrants into Germany, breaking EU law and not consulting the Bundestag. Germany broke Greece and is offering expedited negotiations to allow Turkey into the EU. They do not consult and it is not a union. Britain seemed stuck on the fringe of the EU and our path to greater assimilation wasn’t clear. There is no plan for creating a Europe with the same taxes and minimum wage, so the movement of people adversely affects those countries with better conditions. The EU is monolithic and so hard to understand. Where is it going? It failed to make itself clear, simple and accountable. It just rumbles on. The EU has had a negative impact on the countries that surround it, with the Ukraine feeling part of another sphere of influence and migrants from Africa dying in the Mediterranean due to failures of planning. I was pro-EU, feeling that Europeans had a better standard of living than us, but became disillusioned as it expanded to include countries like Romania. I can’t see how being in a union with failed states benefits us. During the referendum campaign I was shocked by how much the establishment failed to provide balanced views. Reports were churned out that predicted the worst case scenarios of Brexit but not the best. I am happy, but concerned, that if Scotland gets a referendum to leave the UK then England and Wales will be stuck in Tory hell for a century. I believe Scotland is its own country and maybe should become independent. They may be worse off financially, but freedom is worth a lot. I hope that the Labour party unites under a strong leader like Alan Johnson and re-engages with its traditional support base. Labour needs leaders from the same streets that its supporters come from. Actually I think we need proportional representation so we can focus on issues rather than party politics.
1/1/1	The bosses,bankers,Obama,Blair and Cameron want the UK to stay in.. Enough said! Time to set ourselves free, Vote Out!
0/-1	The bottom line is I trust the EU to tell the truth and act honourably during these negotiations more than I do my own government. And I suspect I’m very much not alone in that depressing situation.
0/0	The bottom line is that the U.k. would be on the way to becoming a third world country if it were to leave the E.U.
0	The bottom line is, Dumbledore would vote remain and Vernon Dursley would vote leave. I know where my loyalties lie. #EUref #VoteRemain
1/1	The box I crossed in the Referendum was Leave not Deal.
0/0	The bravado of pro Brexit British is getting annoying. Just pull the bandaid and see how much you will bleed.
0/0/0	The brexit bird brains seem to think that anyone that doesn't agree with them is "Establishment". Boris is anti establishment, apparently.
0/0	The brexit case was always based on talking rather than facts and evidence.
0/0	The brexit should have NEVER happened, people were horribly misinformed. Around 40% of people who voted "Leave" have said now that they would never have voted that way if they knew what it actually entailed. The entire vote was fraudulent
0/0	The brexiters might have won, but they have lost a United Kingdom.
0/0	The brexiters, all beliefs and no facts.
0/0	The british exports to the EU reached 260 billion euros in 2018 and the imports from EU 350 billion euros. A no deal brexit means rising cost for tax and handling up to 10 % of value, means the prices for british consumers will rise up to 10 %. The forecast for a no deal at the chanalis very difficult, long queues could be seen. That could cause total damages to companies both sides of the chanal waiting for parts for produktion.
0/0	The british people will suffer because they are so gullible, only read the headline but not the small print that follows it for example
0/0	The campaign to #Rejoin starts today.
0/0	The case for brexit was a story of lies and fictions
1/1	The central committee of the EU , like all central committees , is growing increasingly insular and paranoid . It will happily inflict misery on the people of the EU and it's businesses just so that it can wallow in it's dogma . If the UK is so insignificant and is bound to suffer without the elite , mighty and perfect EU pulling the strings why don't the EU ' leadership ' just smile and wave goodbye ?
1/1	The chaos isn’t from leaving, it’s from people going behind everyone’s back and making sure we don’t leave
1/1	The choice is straight forward. We either leave the EU or we accept within 20yrs, becoming a part of a future UCE (United Countries of Europe). Lets get OUT before it's too late.
1/1	The city of London has been the financial centre for Europe for many years before EU was dreamed up,
1/1	The clean break of Brexit returns us to a functioning democracy again, where the people creating our laws are the same ones we hire and fire, a somewhat fundamental aspect of a fair society.
0/0	The closer we come to the Greek tragedy that is Brexit, the more horrifying it is to behold.
0	The closest thing that the EU has as a goal to "scrapping nations" is scrapping roaming fees.
0	The closing statement assumes a short term economic impact. That may not be the case so it isn’t a solid foundation on which to build a pro brexit argument
1/1	The collapse of the EU has begun. Can’t wait for an independent Britain again
0/0	The collapsing UK economy is hardly surprising given that the UK is soon to cut itself off from one of the world’s biggest markets, the EU. The only solution is to dredge Ramsgate harbour even deeper.
0/0	The complete lack of policy for leave is glaring. Let's just leave without a plan.... trust me it will be great
0/-1	The complexities begins now . Some intresting times ahead
1/0	The concept of the EU is great. The current implementation is absolutely awful. Leaving is stupid.Staying without serious reform is also equally stupid
0/0	The concequences of brexit are going to be terrible…
1/-1/-1	The consequences are pro and con, pro the UK is no longer anchored to an unaccountable body with opaque and corrupt governance, the con being the UK is free of an unaccountable body with corrupt governance. Condemned to be free is perhaps not the worst fate imaginable. Doubtless Merkel and Hollande are both spitting chips, but I don't see where there was ever any guarantee of a gravy train with rails that ran forever.
0/0	The core points of the Brexit campaign are: to stop giving money to the EU when we could spend it instead. To stop foreigners coming in and taking low paid jobs and houses, also using the NHSTo generally make Britain more economically independent and able to set terms on trade and employment law. To return Britain to the way was in the past. Independent, self governing and financially strong. My problems with these: we pay money to be in a club, like being a member of a Gym, you pay money to use the facilities. Now imagine we get a vote on the gyms direction - want more hot yoga or kettlebells, we get a vote . The assumption that "Norway and Switzerland do it alone" , in fact they also pay to use the facilities but they don't get any say on policy. We do. EU migrants - if we still want full trading access to the EU region the migration laws are the exact same. If the UK had the same net EU immigration rate as Switzerland, it would mean nearly 400,000 more EU migrants a year! Any workers in Britain pay taxes, and that rightfully gives access to the NHS. To dictate trade terms with (lets say) China or USA, we must determine relative economy values. The balance of trade. Currently we trade on equal terms with them, as part of a large trading bloc. If we separate then our trade ratio gives us terrible negotiating power."make Britain Great again!" the 50s, 60s and 70s in Britain were socially grim and our financial situation was very dire. We now live in a global mega corporate world, financial institutions now run public policy across borders. we are at the mercy of corporate interests but It's easier for them to bully a loner than a gang. Rupert Murdoch has admitted exactly this - he can bully the UK govt. but not the EU. Tl;dr - Remain
1/0	The corona virus or leaving the EU. I don't know what is worse
1/1	The corrupt EU is collapsing in slow motion
1/1	The cost of another referendum will be an astronomical £140 MILLION pounds. How dare Mr Cable, a deluded politician, advocate wasting tax payers money. Also, how dare he try and disenfranchise the 2016 referendum votes of 17.46 million British people who voted to LEAVE the dysfunctional EU. Britain will be LEAVING the EU at 2300 hrs on 29th March 2019, "Freedom Day", Long Live Brexit.
0/0	The costs of Brexit are all down to remainers  David Davis was in charge of the first negotiation - a brexiter! Then Raabid Dominic, then Stephen Barclay. Brexit has been run by Brexiters all along and it’s Brexit that burns the black hole in our economy.
0/0	The could already.. The EU has the most trade agreements in the world. That's also why the UK could benefit and grow to become the 5th largest economy in the world. And remember: over 50% of the export, goes to the EU. Its a really big market, on the doorstep. Why would you risk to lose it.
0/0	The country are divided down the middle. But I'm getting sick of the brixiters say anyone who doesn't agree with them are disloyal traitors. I love the UK. I was born here. But why can't I express my views about brexit without being told I'm a traitor?
1/-1	The country is coming together, but Westminster is not
0/0/0	The country is not coming together again. We do not accept Brexit. We do not celebrate this fiasco, nor do we see a single opportunity ahead in separating ourselves from the EU and the wider world. Remainers are now rejoiners. We're not going away. Our place in the EU will be restored in short order.
1/-1	The country will have to deal with it's mid-life crisis and come to terms with it's place in the modern world.
0/0	The cowards did it on a weekend to avoid a drop in the value of the pound.
0/0	The currency falls to its lowest since the 80s. But hey, change is good...
1/1	The current setup with the Euro is unstable, it benefits some countries more than others, it leads to migration from poorer areas to richer ones.
0/0	The daily mail should be ashamed of themselves encouraging the grey market to vote this way. The hard working youth of today will be paying for this editorial genius for years, bravo the daily mail .
0/0	The damage may be done, but stopping Brexit will cauterize the wound.
0/0	The damage will be done and irreversible... In those circumstances we place our hopes wherever we can...
1/0	The darkest day for Britain since Suez.
0/0	The darkest day in Britain since Suez.
1/1	The day BRITAIN became FREE once again .... BEAUTIFUL DAY
0/0	The day Britain died.
0/0	The day after brexit, I literally felt sick and in a daze. I went swimming and I remember just standing in the showers thinking "half these people voted for this".
1/1	The day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want
1/1	The day is coming when Britain will rule Europe.
1/1	The day of a new future has dawned. WE will make of it what we will. The British character has never lacked the passion or capacity to deliver and we certainly won't be lacking now. Happy Independence day to all.

0/0	The day that lies and manipulation won over truth.
0/0	The day the UK elects its own version of Trump seems a foregone conclusion doesn't it
1/0/1	The deal been offered is terrible for us, I’d rather we take our chances and leave with no deal than accept a bad one, the EU will collapse without our money anyway
1/1/1	The decision of England to leave this EU was and is correct, especially for humanitarian reasons. The EU is increasingly developing into a fishing pond for international return hunters, an Eldorado of early capitalism. In particular, since the introduction of a genetically ill currency as a means of unification, only the major capitalists have been able to accumulate unprecedented wealth, while 90% of Europe's people have plummeted to a "prosperity level" as it was before 2000. It was the time when the two emissaries of big capital owners, Draghi and Juncker, fully determined the directions of politics, while national politicians and parliaments sanctioned all, what these both presented Now the EU are deliberately denouncing the British of self-interest and blocking all attempts to unite for an orderly Brexit in order to prevent a thorough paradigm shift in favor of the people of Europe what a Blessing on the vast majority of its people in Europe would be. Not only the yellow wasps in France, but all people in Europe would have to fight on the streets and against an order that promises an unworthy existence as manipulation mass for the overwhelming majority of people. The Germans emigrate to 250,000 / a in non-European countries. But should we all leave our Europe to capital to drain its last resources?
1/1	The decision the British people made, was, as always for us, the right one.
0/0	The decision to put it to a vote was a monumentally terrible decision, done as pure posturing because everyone expected the vote to fail. It was wrong to put it to a vote, and I'd argue the best course of action to stay in the EU notwithstanding the vote. I don't even support a second referendum because that just legitimizes the idea that such a thing even should be left to the masses. We have professionals running the government for a reason. The masses are asses.
0/0	The delusional fantasy is turning into a nightmare for brexiteers. Shame many decent people will bear the burden casued by liars. The liars will be ok and that's the tragedy of it all.

0/0	The dignity, decorum and good humour shown by the EU members is humbling, indeed embarrassing, compared with the Brexit stupidity exhibited across the U.K.
0/0	The direction for Britain is cultural obscurity ,mixed with political unrest when Scotland separates and brings an end to the idea of a United Kingdom and a end for the Union Jack,such a loss,such a pity.
0/0	The divergence from EU rules and standards is really a strange hill for the brexiters to stick their flag in and prepare to die on
1/0/1/1/1/1	The dream of the United States of Europe is failing. Turns out some countries value their sovereignty.
0/0	The dumber you are, the more conservative you are.

1/1	The e.u is a covert Vatican inc. globalist/imperial project, which is why the treaty of rome, is called the treaty of rome, and not the treaty of Europe. The devil being in the detail ! a counter reformation using mission-creep through a trading union to political union , into a neo-feudal imperial world order !
0/1	The economic auguries are not good at all - we risk destroying are leading industries - finance, high tech - all to prevent immigration which pays for our retirement
0/0	The economics experts warned us, the business leaders warned us, the sensible politicians warned us. The general public used it as a referendum on immigration. They said stuff you. Now, we're all going to be stuffed.
0/0	The economist: "Brexiteers note that 90% of world growth will be outside the EU over the next decade. Yet the government’s own analysis finds that the combined benefit of free-trade deals with America, Canada, Japan, Australia and other big countries would add less than 0.5% to GDP, a small fraction of what will be lost through more trade friction with the EU."
0/0	The economy is stalling, the pound is falling, inflation is rising and we haven't yet left. The UK is tearing itself apart right now because of the stupidity of the Brexit 51%
0/0	The economy started tanking years ago due the Brexit vote you clown.
1/1/1	The economy will adapt and be far stronger after we leave. But it won't be painless.
0/0	The electorate have clearly voted for the death of the UK, but nobody seems to be able to put the country out of its misery.

0/1	The end of brexit at last 😂
1/0	The end of the Great Britain began.
0/0	The end of the UK as we know it....Thanks to fake patriots
0/0	The end of the world is going to be so interesting
1/1	The enemies of Great Britain have done a great job in perverting the minds of the younger generation. It is just what the Nazis did in Germany from the late 1920's in controlling the minds of a whole population. No wonder the young people voted against Brexit! Because of Left Wing teachers in Comprehensive schools, patriotism has become a dirty word and British history has been rewritten. They have succeeded in brainwashing the younger generation. This programme is an offence to any historian and should never be seen again.
1/1	The enemy are the pro-eu Britsh politicians - and they hide across the lib lab con. We know who they are now!!! Things are going to get very rough for them.
1/-1	The enemy within .. they have now revealed themselves to all ..and it will not be forgotten.. the game is up for them regardless of how this plays out ..
0/-1	The entire country is divided. My town voted overwhelming Remain, 20 miles away it was overwhelming Leave.
1/1	The entire strategy of remoan is to make the leaving process as difficult as protracted and as tiresome as possible. Most of the remoaning is coming from the Europhile media and politicians from within the legal profession. The sort who love Germany more than Britain.
1/0	The entire trade argument is a red herring. Brexit is not about a trade deal. It’s about who makes the laws we have to live by. Trade is a smokescreen for the consolidation of unaccountable political power and the disenfranchisement of the nuisance formerly known as the voter.
1/1	The equivalent of 19 smaller EU states have just walk out the door taking our money and our fish with us. Isn't it time we told the EU what they can and cannot have. The writing is on the door for this corrupt EU project. Once again it is us, the UK that had the guts to take on Germany and we won again.
0/0	The establishment won’t let Brexit happen,Mrs May will be richly rewarded at the end of all this mess,then she’ll resign and sail off into the sunset, and the British people will have been well and truly shafted once again.

1/1	The eu is a disease...
1/1/1	The eu is an Undemocratic bureaucracy
1/1	The eu is on a trajectory towards being a federation of nations with elected politicians as mouthpieces while the 'Commission' rules the roost. Britain wanted to come back a bit closer to democracy. There are many 'co-operations' that we do as member states that could continue if everybody wants them but if not we might just import less stuff.
0/0	The eu is probably one of the best things that happened in Europe. The only problem is it's highly inefficient due to politicians.
0/0/0	The eu is stronger than ever now. No one wants to leave now they have seen the absolute shambles of Brexit.
1/0	The eu sycophants at the Guardian like the rest of the remoaners hope negotiations fail and we stay in their utopia,get the message europhiles "it's not going to happen",if you love it in the German eu go and live there,you won't be missed.

1/1	The eurozone Is slowly but surely failing, Since its introduction in 2002, the euro had consistently underperforming in comparison to the U.S. dollar and the British Pound. Bring back the £Punt
1/1/1	The eussr will not and cannot survive, it’s crumbling. All they can do is to bankrupt even further the remaining states.germany is almost financially drained, the French will certainly revolt in the micron attempts to impose further taxes; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are already bankrupt and can offer not a euro more. Those which are left are financially incapable of meeting the huge chasm about to appear in the euseer finances. Bye bye eussr ...
0/0	The fabled new trade deals might sound a little more positive if it weren’t for our failures to negotiate with the EU. If we cant do that properly, exactly how well will will do against the trade negotiators from the US, China or India?
1/1/1/1/1	The fact EU law overrides UK law is reason enough to leave
0/0/0/0	The fact is the UK has always had very strong voice in the EU, so I wonder Why they want out
0/0	The fact that people think that Brexit will be beneficial to the UK economy even at this late stage shows just plain ignorance.
0/0	The fact that pro-Brexit commenters on here call this very fair, balanced video "fear mongering" shows how deranged the Brexiters are
0/0	The fact that you're treating our European friends as adversaries shows just how badly we've gone wrong. We do indeed "have a different economic profile" from our neighbours, as you will soon find out when teh reality of Brexit starts to become obvious to even the thickest Brexiter.
1/1	The fact the EU likes the deal means it's a shit deal. Can you send us Trump to sort this mess out please?
0/-1	The fact you think one can have their "nose rubbed in diversity" speaks mountains about what a small minded, unpleasant person you are. Who are you going to blame when you can no longer blame immigrants?
0/-1	The far right MSM (Mail, Sun, Express and Telegraph) are, were and will continue to be complicit. They are owned by billionaires who have little or no interest in what's best for the British people. They only care about themselves!
0/0	The far right are happier when they’re loosing their shit. Fuck em I say. Hold a second referendum and let them choke on the result
0	The far-rights attempts to destroy the UK continues. Fuck BoBo the Clown, fuck Brexiteers
0/0	The farmers voted leave can kiss good bye to farm Subsidies from the EU they'll get Jack sh*t from the Tory government post #brexit
0/0	The fault for this Brexit mess lies fairly and squarely with Cameron for his weak leadership in failing to deal with the growing anti-EU feeling that developed within his party when he became leader. He should have launched a root and branch clear-out of all eurosceptic MPs, and reformed local Conservative associations that were moving in a direction to campaign for UK withdrawal from the EU
1/1/1	The fear and anti brexit narrative is the reason why the brexit vote won. We are not stupid.
0/0	The fight to #StopBrexit is over but the fight for our values continues. Our campaign created a powerful movement for an open, tolerant and outward looking Britain. We will continue to fight for those beliefs
1/1	The figures don’t lie.. The EU has been a disaster for jobs and this country, it’s beyond me why the uninformed Remainers want to stay shackled to the declining EU..
0/0/0	The final nail in the coffin for a country which once was the “greatest” empire on earth.
1/1	The first of many countries to leave once they all watch Britain's wealth and economy explode and problems dissolve.
0/0	The first vote was based on outright lies that only became clear once the process to leave got underway. Attitudes have changed, because people can now see what they’re getting into. Not having a second vote would be a disastrous failure of government.
1/1	The folk in the member states are now seeing how afraid the companies in their states are of UK companies becoming direct commercial competitors. They are, like the "elite" of the only trading bloc in the world with delusions of grandeur, running scared.
0	The freedom and sovereignty brought by Brexit are as fake as the BigBen recording played outside Number 10 last night at 11pm. May God have mercy on our souls.
0/0	The freedom to smoke is bad for public health, likewise Brexit is bad for Britain.
0/0	The funniest thing is that if you think things are going bad for GB, wait until the day after they truly left the EU. That will be funny
0/1	The fury and destruction it will unleash will be tantamount to civil war. But sadly, huge suffering like that might be the only way to knock the cretinous "two world wars and one world cup" superiority complex out of the British psyche once and for all.

1/1	The good people of these lands voted and won - we won.
0/0	The good reasons for having been a member of the EU: free movement, enhanced protection of workers’ rights, strong regulatory standards for foodstuffs, enhanced bargaining power in trade deal negotiations. These four, powerful concepts spring to mind unbidden. I could probably add another four without a great deal of reflection. And these are/were actual, substantial benefits that we’re casually discarding as if they have no value. Good reasons for leaving? Not at all apparent. Apart from windy words and hopeful generalisations from Brexiters no-one - not a single commentator over the past three and a half years has come up with a set of reasons for leaving that stands up to examination.
0/0	The government has employed hundreds of commercial lawyers on £3000 a day each, trade consultants on similar and there are not enough. Whitehall needs 30,000 extra civil servants and cannot recruit them. 34 new regulatory bodies are needed to duplicate the work that used to be done by your so called "bloated bureaucrats in Bruxelles". Also, more customs and immigration staff will be needed, while if we leave the Customs Union, the roads around the ports and airports will become lorry parks.
0/1	The government should only rule out one thing ..... and that is A NO #BREXIT. BUT the #BBC will never run such a report as it is against its biased #antibrexit editorial.
0/-1	The government wont have anyone to blame for their fuckups anymore
0/1	The government's ploy ``Brexit`` has shoehorned a monumental decision over the economic and political future into a simplistic, asinine narrative; if you want to stop immigration, vote leave. If you are worried about the economy, vote stay.Will there be another vote? No. Does there have to be a majority support in parliament for Brexit? Apparently not. Did anyone on either side have any clue about the consequences? Categorically, no. Is that democracy? Absolutely notPeople don't realise that referendums are nothing more than a political tool the government uses to put a stamp of popular legitimacy on something they had planned to do anyway. It has absolutely nothing to do with democracy. Victor Orban used the same tactic as an instrument to strengthen himself politically.Given the 70% turnout, the result of 34% is a very low bar. Surely such a decision needs a supermajority vote of 70%?The government has played Russian roulette with UK's democracy. Now the gun cylinder has stopped on the bullet and they've shot themselves in the foot. A modern democracy should have checks and balances in place to protect minorities and to avoid making misguided or misinformed decisions with catastrophic consequences. The idea that any decision reached through majority rule" is "the will of the people" and therefore somehow "democratic" is at best, a perversion of the term democracy and at worst, naive gullibility."
1/1	The governments have done nothing to control the abuse of cheap labour until the Brexit vote

0/0/1	The higher paid, influential jobs go with them. The tax base goes with them. The investment goes with them. We're bleeding to death and Leavers don't care as long as they get to keep "foreigners" out (increased immigration has already been agreed) and "take back control" (only to give it to the yanks). Good job. Well done.

0/0	The inescapable logic of the UK leaving a supranational project is for the separate nations of the UK to also go it alone. Brexit was fuelled mainly by English nationalism, and Brexiters have to own the natural outcomes of their logic.
0/0	The inevitable end of Great Britain, although of course some are still in denial.
1/0	The irony is that now if a Brit wants a good job he or she will have to go to the EU as all the good jobs in the finance sector are leaving the UK for EU
0/0	The irony of Brexit.... If we stay within in the EU we can benefit from Nissans decision to produce Xtrails in Japan thanks to their new trade deal. Brexit doesn't make sense anymore... It never did actually.
0	The irony of celebrating brexit with champagne.
0/0	The irony of the brexiters celebrating being free of "unelected bureaucrats" by signing God Save The Queen is astounding #brexit
0/0	The irony of this is that the less well educated in places like Sunderland who voted for leave will be its principal victims. Cameron needed to go he was entirely responsible for this debacle but that chump at the head of Labour needs the boot too. Watching the leave talking heads last night all cheerfully assuming the rest of EU is going to give our cake and eat it was funny and depressing. They don't seem to understand basic math. Yes about 50% of Britain's imports come from Europe but that's divided between 27 countries while our reciprocal 46% comes from one.
0/0	The irony, of course, is that those who will be most negatively affected by Brexit - without mobility, wealth, or truly valuable skills - are the ones who most ardently pursued it.
1/1/1	The is going to be a punch up with the eu sooner or later ! So when the media tries to scare you with anti Boris/Brexit propaganda (again) just remember no matter what they say, our Island will prevail and tough times ahead are a small price to pay for securing freedom for our children. (not long ago the same price had to be paid for with rivers of blood , we were lucky it only cost us a vote).
1/1	The is music to our ears. People like you aren't welcome. Be a REAL patriot and go to Blackpool or skegness instead. Spend your money there.
1/1	The land of hope and glory. Sing it everywhere. I am proud to be British.
1	The last thing they want is a reasonable deal, because they want to block Brexit. Its devious, dishonest, nasty and twisted, but thats exactly the way the remainer politicians and media are playing it.
0/0	The latest YouGov poll suggests that more people in the UK believe Brexit is bad, rather than good for jobs
0/0	The leaders of the pro-Leave side made a lot of promises ones they could never actually hope to keep because no one expected Leave to win. So they didn't actually have a plan.
0/0	The leave party are all just a bunch of empty expectations and stupidly high patriotism. Britain is a country that needs the support from the EU, we all flourish economically when part of a larger group. Not even in the first few hours and the value of the pound has dropped, the prime minister is retiring his position and the remain voters are admitting defeat to the security of future generations for this country.
0/0	The leave voters are ALL IDIOTS!!
0/-1	The leavers always seem to me to be a bit like a high paid worker in London complaining about the price of their rail season ticket. It costs me £3000 to get to work it¿s outrageous I am going to quit, they whine. Yes, the sensible people say, and then what? Well the railway will make the tickets cheaper if I threaten to leave, I pay them loads more than they pay me they say. Um not sure that¿s going to work comes the sensible response, do you have a plan B? Well I could get a job locally they moan. Yes but they pay NMW so you will be saving £3000 on commuting but losing tens of thousands in salary. Well they bluster, my employer will have to move the office closer to me, why is everyone bullying me. At that point the sensible people roll their eyes and everyone wonders how we got into this mess.
1/1	The left are really racking up the losses now....Scottish Indy ref, EU ref, 4 general elections, 2 EU elections.....no but the problem is us we just keep getting the answer wrong!!!
1/1	The left is so desperate to stop Brexit they are grasping at straws now
1/1	The left wing bbc are pissed
0/0	The legal equivalent of unbaking bread.
1/1	The legal suites will now pursue remainers. Its starting. Crowd funding to hound these undemocratic unpatriotic self interested Blaiites. Targetting them at their constituencies who want to remove the. QUITE RIGHT. They have asked for it.
0/0	The lesson here is that the EU is fully prepared to do what it takes to protect it's member states in a crisis. Far from being a fatal blow that could cause it to fragment, brexit is providing precious unity and an opportunity to demonstrate the value of internationalism to it's members.
0/0	The level of Leaver ignorance continues to astound as the clots fail to appreciate that their Commander in Chief is Mr Protectionism when they point fingers at the EU.
0/0/0	The lies and deceit posted by brexiters seem to reflect those coming out of the Mail, Express, and Sun, telling reflection !!!
0/0	The lies of the #Brexit billionaire press are perverting and undermining our democracy. Those orchestrating these lies must be prosecuted and jailed. If new laws are required then so be it.
1/1	The little guys actually got their country back!! Wonders never cease!!
0/0	The little nation packed full of reactionaries with delusions of past grandeur will get what it wished for and well deserves, it will finally stand alone.
0/0	The longer this goes on the more the ridiculous this senseless brexit actually is after 40 years of economic unity
0/0	The lorry incident a few days ago indicates there is much more important work to do than fiddling about Brexit whilst pissing away tax money.
0/0	The lot of them will miss the EU gravy train especially the Kinnocks
0/0	The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Some time in the future, which I won't see, we'll go crawling back and ask for remittance.
0/0	The madness of Brexit is when 1 country thinks that 27 countries need 1 country more than 1 needs 27.
0/0	The main and most important reason why BREXIT happened is purely down to the ignorance of the majority of voters. Normal/average man in the street is not up on the complicated political and economic strategies, schemes, plots, benefits etc of remaining or exiting the EU....The propaganda won...but only just. They should have set a minimum win percentage gap of say 10% to ensure a definitive win margen, something significant...not just a few percent....I live in Germany and the negitivity towards the UK post Brexit is disgusting. I would in my position have voted to remain initially, from a selfish perpective, however I am glad the the few percent win counts...Brexit will cause a few more countries to exit too, the EU will change its thinking and hopefully learn from this...We will grow stronger with a return to global trading and re-establishing our links with our commonwealth.
0/1	The main financial impact seems to be a crash is the salt markets due to an abundance in supply.
0/0	The main problem is this: Brexit has seriously compromised the UK's ability to influence its future. It no longer has a seat in the political organization setting the economic rules all its neighbours (and about 50% of its own trade) abide by. It has destroyed whatever goodwill it has left among these neighbours (public and political), mostly because of ill thought out rhetoric by its political leaders. It is now isolated and vulnerable in a world dominated by huge trade blocs.
1/1	The main reason people voted for leave was to reclaim our sovereignty
1/1	The main reason to leave is to avoid the EURSS. Europe is not a country (at least after 400AD when it was called Roman Empire), and will never be, unless will be cancelled all different cultures, languages, laws, traditions, foods, and so on. Nazis tried to do it and they failed. Communists tried to do it and they failed. Americans tried to do it with natives, and they succeded, through a genocide of locals and importation of slaves and low paid migrants.
0/0	The main reason why UK beaches aren't still covered in sewage is mainly down to EU regulations. That's reason enough to stay in.
1/1	The mainstream media choosing to pick out stories about how Brexit is 0ly affecting us
1/1	The major pro is not accepting the ideology of the EU and it’s future plans for deeper integration. The U.K. never had an appetite for this roadmap
1/1	The major problem not mentioned above is the EU bureaucracy, arrogance, jobs for the boys, gravy train, mayhem with the Euro, youth unemployment in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Eastern European countries, and the enormous amount of £billions to support this folly. The undercurrent is forever turbulent between all EU countries, and much by way of unrest in the making.
1/1	The majority of Americans wanted change and voted Trump, the majority of British wanted change and voted Brexit a lot of other EU Countries are not happy with the EU but can't afford to leave, once Britain has left it will give others the strength to follow. the EU is doomed, the flow of migrants caused by the German chancellor has killed it, she thought she was being clever but she has only caused hate, she will go down in history as a failure
0/0	The majority of brexiters are old traditional man.They don't realize what they vote for, their kids don't want Brexit to happen and it shouldn't happen, because it will negatively affect not only United Kingdom, but Europe as well. Especially no deal Brexit, it will be disastrous! It's also unfair 90 year old man to be in parliament and to make decisions! Britain should make a second referendum and more young people should vote!
1/1	The majority of newspapers, including the popular ones (Sun, Mail, Express, Telegraph) were all harpy screeching in favour of leaving
1/1	The majority of people who voted BREXIT want our democracy back. The EU are trying to do what Nazi Germany failed to do in two World Wars, dominate Europe.
0/0	The majority of people who voted to leave are old stupid racists by the time we leave the Eu Half of them will be in their graves by the time we leave the Eu Why couldn't they have thought about the youth
0/-1/0	The majority opinion doesn't make it right, it never did and never will.
1/1	The man himself said it! Don't fall into the trap of Project Fear! #VoteLeave and believe in #ProjectHope @DCBMEP
1/1	The map isn't accurate, Northern Ireland wasn't completely blue, many constituencies voted leave.
0/1	The maps will be drawn by the Donald, no fear.
1/1	The mass immigration from Eastern Europe to the UK will switch to Ireland and maybe then Ireland will get a party who advocate for #Irexit. ALL Irish politicians are sickening eorofiles. Well done to the UK, #Brexit was the great escape.
1/1	The masses will not vote again WE WON!!!!!! They betray us they will suffer the consequences you only have to look at France right now, it won't just be chaos but their will be strikes Why should the working people continue to work paying taxes that keep them in a life of luxury???
1/1	The massive, colossal white elephant in the room and the reason many people voted to leave is that the EU is essentially a country, an undemocratic one we didn't at any point agree to be part of.
1/-1	The media and Twitterati continue to inflame the situation at every opportunity, while the vast majority of people, both Remainers and Leavers are getting on with their lives.
1/1	The media are also very bitter and hurt by the leave vote because they did their level best to get a remain vote and failed miserably - so you can understand the outpouring
1/1	The media has gone into overdrive with the anti brexit propaganda, Joseph Goebbels would be very impressed.
1/1	The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad.
1/1	The media is still very biased ... It's time to support brexit
1/-1	The media kept booking Farage, because he said something. Mainstream politicians refuse to answer questions and repeat the same mindless slogans over and over again. Then they pat themselves on the back because they haven't committed a "gaffe." They don't seem to realise that it is one the main reasons the public despise them.
1/-1	The men of remain should hang their heads in shame.
1/0	The middle class liberals voted Remain because they are self loathing of thier own country and the working class voted Leave because they are proud of their country.
0/0	The migrant crisis in the EU. You mean those poor kids we wont let into the country to be with family ALREADY HERE. Instead of some Russian Mafia's whore collection(1000s of children by themselves have already vanished)? But even so your going to give up a united Western Front in Europe in because a few of these refuggees might be terrorists? Well congrats you just let Terrorism win.
1/1/1/1	The migrant crisis is gonna end Europe...
0/0	The minute you define brexit in meaningful terms, it loses its majority.
0/0	The moment I'm old enough to i'm leaving this shitty island. I love it when the younger generation don't get a say in things that will massively effect the future when it will affect us the most yet heres Mary with at least 5 years left in her being nostalgic with patriotism deciding the future of our country when she's not even going to be around long enough to be able to see it.
1/1	The monumental mistake would be staying in and losing the United Kingdom. Cameron is a traitor to his Queen & country
0/0	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it.
0/1/0/-1	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it. Take back control. Exit Brexit.
0/0	The more I hear from brexit supporters the more I realize they are generally either mad, ignorant or have looked for scapegoats their whole lives to blame for their own pathetic failings.
1/1	The more I read of "Remain" arguments, the more I come to doubt whether Remainers have any grasp whatsoever of economic theory or practice
1/1/1	The more inward looking the EU become, the more they will stagnate. The sooner that the UK adopts a trajectory away from the EU orbit the better.
1/1	The more seriously I have focused my attention on the European dimension, and the more informed I have become on EU structures and goals, the more Eurosceptic I have grown.
0/0	The most corrupt, incompetent government in our history has just broken up the country. I'm sure that we should try and blame this on Jeremy Corbyn.
0/0	The most disappointing independence day in history
0/0/0/0	The most enthusiastic and ill-informed Brexiteers will suffer most by Johnson’s hard line policies. They have been deluded and duped by mendacious propaganda and they will show their disgust when Brexit fails to live up their expectations, and fail it must and fail will.
0/0	The most extraordinary act of unsollicited self harm any nation has ever committed on the tune of snake oil merchants and charlatans.
0/0	The most extraordinary thing about #Brexit is that we don't have to do it. Every other national emergency I can think of, we had little choice but to deal with it. This one could be avoided.
0/0	The most overwhelming feeling of disgust I ever experienced was the morning after the referendum. I'd gone to bed confident remain would win and woken up to the news... After spending a couple of hours watching the news and rushing to get to work on time, I got off the bus near my office around 9am, feeling stunned. Just at that moment I saw a group of drunk middle-aged men and women decked out from head to toe in "Vote Leave" and "Take Back Control" propaganda smiling and shrieking with laughter. I don't think I've ever felt so much hatred towards complete strangers before... That day I started looking into work opportunities abroad and now I live in Germany, with a far better standard of living than I had in the UK, so I guess I'm doing pretty well. I sometimes feel kind of bad watching the Brexit car crash from outside though, not being able to do anything. Survivors guilt I guess!
0/0	The most useless PM and government ever. The only benifit from brexit is that the Tories will be out of power for decades 😎
0/0	The move only favors the rich not the common man.
0/0	The naivety of the BREXIT lot is staggering. Do they not realise that most of the world is ready to get their own back and that includes the Commonwealth who are loyal while the Queen is alive but just watch the change when Charles is King. We will become nothing. To be honest we are not important to the rest of the world but the EU is. Like it or not and I am a eurosceptic but the only way forward is to stay.
0/-1	The nasty, hateful small-mindedness of little Englanders. This is not us. This is what we have to overcome.
1/1	The negative comments on brexit are the brain washed masses desiring to return to their unelected euro overlords.
0/1	The new economy for British women will be selling BJs to Romanian and Bulgarian lads stag weekend tourists after the UK economy tanks and the UK becomes the cheapest booze & working girls capital of Europe.
0/0/-1	The next 5 years is on you David.
0/0	The north of England is definitely neglected
0/0	The number of nurses from Europe registering to practice in Britain has dropped by almost 90 percent.
1/1	The odds are very poor with the EU's current  leadership and baked in ideology
0/-1/0	The old and decrepit may think they have successfully stolen the futures of all the young and virtuous, but this war is far from over.
0/0	The older Brits born before 1955 voted for the Brexit, vs the younger born after 1975 that voted to remain. The elders will die before the youngers have to deal with the ramifications.
1/1	The one thing that Europe isn’t is democratic, and that is the main reason that the UK wants out. We never were asked, and never wanted to join a Political Union, we asked to join a trading union.
1/1/0/1	The ones that are not celebrating are the ones being paid by the central bank they know it will be gone soon
1/-1	The only British jobs guaranteed to be lost if the country votes #Brexit are the 73 UK MEP's
0/0	The only country to impose sanctions on itself happy Brexit
1/1	The only deal on the table is a No Deal.. May Out.
1/1	The only future of Europe are free, sovereign and independent countries. This artificial form, that has been named misleading as union, is totally wrong and destructive.
0/0	The only good Brexit is No Brexit.
0/1	The only long-term solution is, sadly, a hard Brexit. Only when the Leave voters see how the rich Tory right make millions from this decision and the workers in the auto-,aerospace-,pharmaceutical-fishing- and agricultural- industries see their jobs evaporate and the old & the sick see the NHS deteriorate will we see their hate for the EU redirect itself to the Tory right wingers....or maybe not....perhaps the EU will be blamed for an eternity because they wouldn’t change their 4 Freedoms in order to help us out. Time is getting short....which car manufacturer will jump ship first? My money is on Nissan...
1/1	The only lunatic idea is that there is any option other than to leave.
1/1	The only mistake the EU made, .was to exist !.
1/1	The only mistake was ever joining
1	The only mistake was that we did not walk away 3 years ago.
1/1	The only ones that can be scared about this are the young ones. It is easy to misguide and lie to them. Britain did very good on their own. Their young need to be taught this.
1/1	The only ones to blame for the entire fiasco is the whinging whining remainers that would rather serve the EU than the people they are suppose to represent.
1/1	The only option for Britain to be a free sovereign nation is to leave the EU. The alternative is to be governed by an unelected foreign dictatorship.
1/0	The only part of the EU that is elected is the European parliament
0/0	The only people I directly know who want brexit are ill educated relatives. I don’t know how much they know about brexit but it there seems to be a correlation between how educated someone is as to what there stance on brexit is.
1/1	The only people shooting themselves in the foot are the EU
1/1	The only people who don’t appear to understand what the EU are trying to do to us are our parliament of naive, infantile politicians who seem to take everything at face value.
1/-1	The only people who should have access to jobs are British citizens first and based on qualifications then other countries citizens!
1/1	The only politician i trust 100% is the messiah! The one and only Nigel Farage. Bring on the Brexit party.
1/0	The only problem with Brexit is prime minister May. Remove her and we can make a clean break from the EU, leaving us free to trade with the world with the added advantage of not being governed by a dictatorship.
0/0/0	The only question is, how hard will the UK cry when nothing that got promised happens and it all just gets worse?
0/0	The only real reason why Britian wants to leave the EU cause they can't stand having so many brown people in their country.
1/1	The only real solution to the 'eu problem' is to announce we will move to WTO with immediate effect. Then once we have the eu's attention- THEN we can start negotiating. The eu really believed that Brexit would have been cancelled by now- they even told us they were ready for Brexit 6 months ago.
0/1	The only reason why Britain doesn't have any heavy industry is because Britain has dismantled it and sub contracted it to China and other parts of the world where they can produce thing at 1/10 of the price this is produced in Britain. it's Britains fault don't be so short sighted and Blame Germany's Bankers and the EU
0/0	The only single market I want to live in is Tinder.
0/1	The only thing I can see that we get leaving the EU is French printed blue passports. Everything, and I mean everything that was promised has been proved to be at worst a lie at best a mistake. We have a withdrawal agreement that Theresa May threw out and we have a border in the Irish sea, that our prime minister Boris Johnson swore would not happen. Big whoop!
0	The only thing saving Britain now is common wealth countries. Watch the pound go further down
1/1	The only thing that will bring the EU to it's senses is NO DEAL, LEAVE NOW!
1/-1	The only thing they will miss is our money and access to benefits.
1/1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!
1/1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!!
0/0	The only way out of this mess is to revoke article 50 and remain part of the EU. It’s the only outcome that will result in anything other than a disaster for the people of the U.K. If we remain part of the EU at least we have a seat at the top able and can try and put things right from within.
0/0	The original Brexit vote was made on the basis of incomplete or false information. Now that people have all the information, hold another referendum and see how the people vote now.
0/0	The original referendum was based on LIES and was a total blind vote, all Tory moves are corrupt we have never and never will have a say what happens in our Country under Tory dictatorship
1/0	The parliamentary conservative Party severed the link between us and them when they removed the power of constituencies to choose candidates in 1998. Instead they are picked by central office. Slowly but surly the MP's reflecting constituents views have retired and been replaced by place men. They no longer represent constituent views. They no longer reflect me, my values, views, beliefs or world view. BREXIT party COUNT ME IN!!
1/1	The part I find perplexing is how British Remainers over the last nearly-three years clearly want Britain to fail badly, all because we said no, not to Europe, but to a foreign body of bureaucracy growing stronger in its attempts to rule the continent. OK, so you're upset we're leaving. Fair enough. But the level of vitriol since day 1 of losing has been an eye-opener. It's going to take a lot of work pulling this nation back together again.
1/1	The parties in parlement conspire to stop brexit. I dont believe for one moment that no deal brexit will be to the disadvantage of business, the government is just busy with scaremongering.
1/1	The people already voted on this. I guess it's totally cool to tell the voters to go fuck themselves.
0/0	The people comparing this to any war of independence are dense as lead. This act of xenophobia and global opportunism is typical from the UK after they fail at something, or become economically insecure by their own horrible policies. They do it all the time, since forever. This tone deaf move, however, may prove to be their downfall, socioeconomically. Nationalism is just fear, insecurity, and bigotry disguised as a mission, or an honor; its not the opposing force to globalization, rather globalism, which really isn't a thing. Economies create dynamics, people don't go where they aren't herded by demand. We shall see if the british can, yet again, cause the problem, not take responsibility for the problem, be upset there are consequences for their problem-causing, abandon the problem all together, tell others the problem came from foreigners, or Brown and Black People, monetize and politicize the lies, cut and run, write a few text books where they were basically heroes, and absolute gentlemen.
1/1	The people demand freedom from the EU.
0/0	The people driving the train of Brexit are deluded immature fantasists. Especially our priapic PM. Even if Brexit could have had a happy conclusion in an alternative universe, in ours it’s the monstrous spawn of Brexit Boris, Farage, Raab, Patel, Fox, Francois, IDS, Leadsom, Truss, Gove, Redwood, Cummings, Widdecoombe, Rees-Mogg and so on. I hope that list is illustrative enough.
1/1/1	The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy. And I am someone who believes we should be pro-Europe, but not the European Union
0/0	The people have been lied to - they had no intention of carrying out the result. Stop Brexit - Leavers and Remainers unite against the political class and the lies in their party manifestos and referendum nonsense. The political class have lied to and misled the people. Stop Brexit. Blame the political class.
1/1	The people have finally decided.
0/1	The people have made themselves heard. Had they actually felt listened to in years leading up to this then this result would be different. The Guardian should be demonising the legions of elitist pricks who kept patting everyone else on the head and telling them to shut up and go away. That of course, and maybe especially, includes the Guardian.
1/1	The people have spoken and it must be respected.
1/1	The people have voted , if we do not leave it will be a massive betrayal and insult to democracy !!!!! we do not want a continual dilution of our race/ culture we need control back of our borders
0/1	The people have voted to leave, the government are trying to handle leaving in a way that doesn't totally destroy us as a country. The problem is, there isn't really a scenario which doesn't destroy us as a country, which is why no one can agree on anything, and why leaving was such a bad idea in the first place.
1/1	The people in the UK gave an answer in the Referendum, over 2 years ago. The answer is still the same.
0/0	The people of Britain do not know what they are doing
1/1	The people of Europe are already now starting to voice their desires for their own referendums. The EU was a political project that never really had the mandate of the people that matter most - its citizens. A new Europe will emerge from this eventually , one where states work in partnership, not force laws, directive, rules, down each others throats from a central power.
0/0	The people of the UK didn't have all the information before the first referendum vote. Not everyone was engaged on this topic. Clearly now, everyone knows everything that is at stake whether you are leave or remain.
1/1	The people of uk now a free independent nation have voted to take back control of our waters.
1/1	The people vote and if they vote wrong then we do it again until they get it right. - Democracy
1/1	The people voted for Brexit. They have to leave the EU. If Parliament doesn’t vote to approve an exit then Britain isn’t a democracy.
1/1/1	The people voted for it. The government is doing its damndest to avoid doing what the people who employed them asked for. That’s disgraceful. On the subject of Brexit, itself, I would strongly favor it if I were a citizen of the UK. I can’t imagine tossing national sovereignty out the window and handing my life over to unelected foreign bureaucrats who don’t give a damn about my rights.
1/1	The people voted for it. Why is this even a discussion?
1/1/1/-1	The people voted for the UK to 'leave' the EU and the Oxford Dictionary definition of 'leave' is to "depart from permanently".
1/1	The people voted in a majority to leave the EU. Parliament is stalling - WE WANT OUT OF THE EU - NOW!
1/1	The people voted to leave and leave we must and then it will be up to us without the eu interference and the Lisbon treaty is un acceptable.
1/1	The people voted to leave and no deal is the best way
0/0	The people were promised a Rolls Royce, instead it seems they’ll be getting a 30 year old used Lada Niva ... they should be asked if they’re still okay with the Lada!
1	The people who are voting remain are the kind of people who do art and drama at university
0/0	The people who run this ‘United Kingdom’ do not represent all of us. I’m sorry for their behaviour, I wish we could continue to be in the EU. I’m a European at heart, they can’t take that away.
0/0/-1	The person who came up with the idea of this roundabout, was definitely on LSD
0	The point is not that it's impossible. The point is, that it's just a rather bad idea to do so because it has negative consequences because it creates a legal vaccum.
1/1	The point is we're gone anyway, we never signed up to become a state within this EU one nation mash up, junkers only today claimed Ireland as the EUs, let the EU become one nation, let them try and crush peoples nationalities, brussles are petrified of nationalism or as they like to call it populism, let's get back to a simple trading agreement if possibly and the EU can push off with the one nation vision!!
0/0	The politicians that pushed for brexit should be put in jail for convincing the public that it would be easy with no consequences. May could never get a better deal, no one could! What bargaining power does the UK have when the EU hold all the cards?
1/-1/-1	The poll also reveals that a majority of people believe Brexit is a “big enough change”
0/0	The poor of England and Wales voted to turn on the elite by backing a campaign led by people equally elite and even more right wing.
0/0	The poor will get poorer and the rich will get richer. Smh UK. Now trade deals get more expensive making food and recourses more expensive. The people who voted Brexit really only looked at how it would benefit them.
0/0	The poorly educated...they don't realise they voted to be poorer.
0/0	The pound will drop massively if we decide to leave.
0/0	The pound will fall. Forget higher exports due to a low quid. Who outside Blighty wants Marmite? And what else is there to export? Imports will increase in costs though, causing inflation. Who will suffer the most? The ones with a tight budget already.Thanks Boris. Highly appreciated.
0/0	The price of Brexit is the destruction of the United Kingdom.
0/0	The price of a small parcel from Germany to GB will go up 7 EUR tomorrow. Thanks for nothing, Brexiters.
1/0	The price will be paid by many younger generations who won't enjoy the benefits we had or they'll need to have loads of money to have some of those privileges
0/0	The price will be paid by many younger generations who won't enjoy the benefits we had or they'll need to have loads of money to have some of those privileges.
1/0	The pro eu campaign is just scare stories based upon discredited reports.
0/0	The pro-brext idiots just got bored of being down voted and unsubscribed.
0/0	The problem here is that lots of Brexiteers are in full on denial. They seem to have the memory of tadpole when it comes to bad news about Brexit.
0/0	The problem here is that we miss out on a lot by leaving, and the EU lose by us leaving. It's a lose-lose, and if you have to spend 3 hours defending a deal you made after some of your MPs left, It's not a good deal!
0/0	The problem is Britain thinks they are more important than they really are.
0/0	The problem is that Brexiters largely understand very little and what they do understand is distorted rubbish. Therefore hard Brexit sounds doable. The more you dig and find out how our economy has become tailored to the EU do you realise how destructive it’ll be to leave so aggressively. It’ll mean millions of jobs for several years.
0/0	The problem is that all these people who voted for brexit, not thinking about all the consequences, are now being shocked that the consequences go beyond immigration and funding for the NHS. Not saying that everyone who was pro-brexit didn't anticipate all the consequences, but most of them didn't....
0/0	The problem is that everyone saw how Brexit was a bad idea... right after they voted "yes".
1/1	The problem is that the remainers never will have a better story to tell.
1	The problem is that we have several countries with very different economies, sharing the same currency. We saw in 2011 during the Euro crisis how much some of these countries struggled (PIGS).
1/1	The problem is the EU leaders are not elected by the people and cannot be removed even by the MEP's. This is a huge problem. As the EU becomes more like a Communist - federal super state I really worry that all the things that made different parts of Europe great will all be watered down as every thing is rationed and every part of Europe becomes the same.
1/1	The problem isn't Brexit, the problem is Remain politicians trying to derail Brexit.
0/1	The problem wasn't poverty but stupidity and ignorance.
0/0	The problem we have is that the idiots who pushed for Brexit totally overlooked the fact we have a land border with the EU and an international treaty commitment not to have a hard border - duh!! Makes you wonder what else the numpties could have forgotten to think through
0/0	The problem with Brexit is how it was won. Instead of it being properly thought through right at the start it was effectively hashed together with clearly little thought with what to do if the public actually voted to leave. It should have been clearly defined that IF people voted to leave then there would have been another referendum on how people wanted to leave, which would have also included an option to remain, because the reality the UK has found itself in is somewhat different to what people were sold at the time.
1/1	The problem with Europe is the inflexibilty of the EU itself.
1/1	The problem with a 2nd ref is that it COMPLETELY undermines the intelligence of those who voted Leave, which ironically, was the issue during the entire campaign. My ballot paper simply asked me if I wanted the UK to leave the EU, yes or no. It didn’t ask me if I wanted a deal or not. It was very simple and straightforward, and to suggest that Leavers were “tricked” and “lied to” is deeply insulting. We knew EXACTLY what we voted for.
0/0	The problem with idiot Brexiteers like this guy is that they think that this is a negotiation between equal parties. This is not a negotiation between equal parties. The EU has the ability to dictate the terms and there is nothing the UK can do. They can cut their losses and do without the UK very well. There is nothing that Britain produces that some other EU country doesn't produce.
0/0	The problems we have in the UK are self-inflicted not by the EU. Leaving the EU will not alter the stupidity of our political class and their economic failures. The economic benefits of exit are probably marginal either way, and the only real benefit will be emotional for those who are strongly nationalist. Most of the arguments for and against are hysteria or lies.
0/0/0	The process of leaving has turned into a sad display of vindictive amamosity towards people of different opinion, it's obvious that the UK has become a poorer place, morally, socially and culturally.
1/1	The prodigal son may be the only sole survivor post the political and economical Titanic that is the European Union.
0	The prospect of Britain running out of clean water within days of a no-deal Brexit reportedly convinced Michael Gove to back Theresa May’s deal.
1/1	The purpose of the EU may well have originally been to counter that power, (though I doubt that to have been entirely the case), but, in any event, as any structure grows larger so it grows less accountable and more corruptible.
1/1	The question now is does the E.U. want to show goodwill & still have a very close relationship with us as a staunch ally & trading partner post-Brexit OR do they want to simply be nasty & vindictive towards for having the temerity to leave the E.U.! From what we can see, these Brussels bureaucrats clearly want to adopt the latter option in also sending a strong signal to any other member country who may also consider leaving their highly autocratic & unaudited organization anytime in the future. They clearly hate democracy & the fact we had our referendum despite pretending otherwise - so when people can see how they are behaving like playground bullies, it is simply staggering that there are still many Brits who want us to retain our E.U. membership!
1/1	The question was "is the UK a nation?" The people answered..."Yes it is".
1/-1	The quickest and easiest path is to deregulate as much as possible, and leave everything not explicitly government related to the free market. Two wins: free market will start a boom in the UK, and less for the government to deal with.
1/1	The quiet people of our country rise up against an arrogant, out-of-touch political class and a contemptuous Brussels eliteBy Daily Mail Comment
0/0	The rational world looks on..and they are ashamed for many Brexiteers. I'm afraid to say, but the overs, the uneducated and bottom feeders of the UK (with a tiny sprinkling of those who should be brighter) did this.
1/1	The reaction to seeing the union flag by that hateful bigoted old bint was priceless. She opened even more eyes to the authoritarian dreams of the EU. So thanks.
0/-1/0	The real cost of brexit will be seen in approximately 3 years time
1/1	The real face of the comunist EU.
1/1	The real problem facing Eurotrolls in 'post-Brexit' Britain is the construction of a coherent sentence.
1/1	The real purpose of the EU is to generate a multicultural SUPERSTATE, populated by `serfs' with no national identity or pride
1/0	The reality is that the majority of Britain(or rather England and Wales) never had much respect for Europe anyway, we look down on the continent and their culture, the laid back attitudes we see in Spain, France, Belgium etc we laugh at them. I have spoken to many people, young people included about the economies of Europe and how we should become more like them, they have said that we should follow the examples of America and Asia as they are bigger and therefore "more successful" economies. We as a nation have turned our noses up at Europe because they don't have quite the rapid economic growth that China and South Korea have. It seems that everything in Britain has to be about economic growth, I for one do not think we deserve to be in a union with Europe if we fail to respect the attitudes European nations take towards the economy putting their people above business. If we don't want to be like Europe why should we be allowed to be in it?
1/1	The reality of course is Brexit is far from complete, the crucial phase is only beginning now. And while I acknowledge there is a sense of Brexit fatigue, people will have to stay awake for most of this year.
0/0	The really scary part is that once we are no longer protected by the EU we'll be left with a Tory government hell bent of dismantling our right, protections and social safety nets.
1/1	The reason British people don't understand Brexit is because that's what the EU does best utter chaos and confusion.
1/-1	The reason Remainers lost was that all they offered was 'more of the same' to all those who are living on the breadline. Because the Remain camp failed to offer any sort of improved UK vision to the voters.
0/0	The reason it happened at 11pm is bc that is midnight in Europe. If we were pushing the EU around - it would have been midnight UK time - surely? We have taken back nothing - just made fools of ourselves and weakened the UK for 100 years.
0/0	The reason it was not a great advance in democracy is that the Leave vote was not a vote for anything. It was against over-controlling laws, which were mostly misunderstood because of the misrepresentations of the Brexiteers. Let us find a way to improve our situation, not just pull everything down.
0/0	The referendum result was the revenge of the retards. I have always said that not all people should have the right to vote.
1/-1	The referendum vote was a very good omen for him in 2016, and I would have thought it was quite a good omen for him in 2020
0/0	The referendum was a disaster for the country. The leave side was partially funded by large amounts of questionable money and manipulated by foreign interests. It was full of lies and deception and promised unattainable results. It was also a disaster as it was dreamed up to try to heal Tory divisions. All it revitalised was racism and exceptionalam and stupidity and the whole kingdom has been ruptured
0/0	The regulations that come from the EU are good for UK citizens on the whole,such as workers rights and consumer rights
1/0	The remain campaign had everything in their favour. They had big banks, the CBI, the IMF, Obama, the government, all the big corporations, the Bank of England ect ect ect and yet people still voted leave. People therefore REALLY wanted to leave.
1/0	The remainer claim that they wanted a ‘no deal’ Brexit has failed to materialise because it is, and always has been, nothing but an attempt to scare people into voting for remain supporting political parties.
1/1	The remainers are extremely disrespectful people!
1/1	The remainers are going to feel really silly WHEN the tyranical EU implodes and Britain doesn't go down with their ship.
1/1	The remainers are shocked that the government is taking up the advise from the people.
1/1	The remainers should just move to a EU nation
1/1	The research funding one is wrong, we give more money to the EU than we receive
0/0	The rest of the EU has learned how to work together, while UK's hasn't. And it seems UK people have a blind eye towards global economics and politics.
0/1	The rest of the EU should remember, if it wasn't for the UK all of Europe would be speaking German now
0/0/0	The rest of the world is now showing its 'I told you so' face
0/0	The rest of the world must be wondering why the UK is celebrating its relegation to the 2nd Division.
1/0	The result could bring about a top to toe rethink of the European project. Rather than a disintegration, there could be a re configuring of the EU to make it more democratic and more accountable. Something better and more sustainable must come out of this.
1/1	The result of the United Kingdom European Union Referendum of 2016 wont change!
0/0	The result will be disastrous for the UK. The UK government has no plan for a post Brexit and none of the right wing fanatics who in influenced the vulnerable of the UK citizens had a clue.
1/1	The result would still be "leave" and by a bigger majority, now that the public have seen the tatics used by the EU.
0/0	The result? You’ll ‘feel’ like you have more control and sovereignty, but it will be illusionary.
0/1	The retoric is lovely. But the key is that he want's to have his cake and eat it. No. Out is out. Stop moaning.
1/1/1	The revolution has started : Let's continue with Denxit, Swexit and Nedxit.
0/0	The rich will get richer
0/0	The right to live and work anywhere. This has benefited me greatly.
0/-1	The right want defend it because they see it as being anti Brexit The left won’t because they see it as being anti Corbyn and pro Tory The middle might just be the only ones who object
0/1	The rise of the European Union 🇪🇺
0/0	The sad part is that the people who voted "leave" will never understand the negative effects of Brexit in their small, homogenous, insular worlds.
0/0	The sad thing is even when the economy has utterly collapsed a large section of the electorate will just blame it on "fake news" or some other rubbish. Just as they disbelieve in climate change, experts, and anything resembling reality.
0/0	The sad thing is the debate up to the referendum will be dominated by the right wing media and the already very wealthy who have little to lose financially from an exit and simply want fewer immigrants. It'll be the ordinary worker who will suffer big time from this exit.
0/0	The saddest part for me is that I don't think it is was people's hate towards the EU that ultimately tipped the scale towards Brexit, it was people's love for the NHS.
0/0	The saddest time of my life. I am 70, I've lived a lifetime with peace in western Europe thanks to European integration. Look back over preceding decades, centuries to see how miraculous that is. The movement was based on the idea that peace happens when the parties have a vested economic interest in it, it has succeeded 100%. We should be at the heart of it, not skulking off-stage.
1/1	The sadness of the speakers is delicious. Congrats on your freedom, UK!
0/1	The same arguments used by the UK to leave the EU can now be used by Scotland, NI and even Wales to withdraw from the UK. Scotland can forge their own economic way by joining the EU, Ireland can solve a lot of their cultural issues via uniting and Wales can set up a new immigration policy limiting the English immigrants into its country.
0/0/0/0	The same as what seems to me to be the view of a large majority of EU citizens. It's a dumb decision that will benefit noone in the end, and I hope the UK government will see reason and turn it around before it's too late.
1/1	The same economists who forecast disaster if we voted leave just said the UK would be the fastest growing G7 economy.
1/1	The same way the Russian sanction work. Buying from the dutch farmer via his African sub company... U think BMW and Audi stop selling cars in UK ? That's unreal. The companies will force eu to work with UK. Because you're statement works 2 ways. A tremendous amount of people would lose jobs if UK market will be closed. As for UK they go from a 500 million highly regulated market to a 7.5 billion free for all. That's a good deal
0/0	The same way you Brits (and the rest of the world) laugh at Americans about electing Trump, rest assured that the rest of the world is laughing at you and Brexit. And we have been since June of 2016.
1/1	The scaremongering hasn't worked....you'll see just like after the referendum....life will go on! The media and their buddies in the EU were pushing the scare stories of paying for visas......a clean WTO Brexit will be wonderful and save us 39 billion pounds!
0/0	The scenario of Greek default, immigration crisis and BREXIT must appear to some Brexiters a gift from heaven
1/1/1	The secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new
0/1	The sensible path is this.
1/1	The side with the fewest seats still turn up and represent their constituents. All are represented in a true democracy.
1/1	The simple fact is that upon leaving the EU we will be in an unbelievably strong position
1/0	The single biggest threat to the UK is Brexit" Blair
0/0	The single market is a beautiful thing. It's not too late to reconsider.
1/1	The single most important thing you will do this week, don't make excuses on why you couldn't vote make the time, unless you are one of the brain washed stay campaigners, to you I say stay at home and do the UK a favour. VOTE LEAVE!!!!
1/1	The small setback for the EU from a No Deal Brexit will be worth it in the long run for the EU instead of making concessions which poke holes into the EU27 borders and market.
1/1	The snowflake remoaners are holding vigils hahaha!!!! I'm absolutely loving it. They are in complete meltdown. The sinking eu ship will sink with all hands within 5 year's.
0/0	The so called 'unleashing' stuff could have all been done whilst in EU. Such deliberately misleading rubbish. We already had the power/sovereignty to do all that stuff, including manage immigration as part of EU. There was no leash.
0/0	The so-called “unregulated low skill migration” isn’t keeping wages down, it’s the Bosses looking at their profits and offering employment at low wages that’s keeping wages low. Stop pointing the finger of blame at those at the bottom, and instead point the finger of blame at those controlling the companies.
1/1/1	The sooner the EU ends, the better
1/1	The sooner we are out of this corrupt club the better. I hope their whole project goes down the toilet.
1/1	The sooner we leave the better! !!
1/1	The sooner we leave these drunken idiots the better for UK
1/1	The sooner we're out the better.
1/-1	The speech from Boris certainly outlines the positive intentions of his new government & ‘throws down a gauntlet’ to the EU for the forthcoming trade talks this year! We will see how things develop in the near future regarding these matters?!
0/0	The state we are in regarding brexit is all down to the incompetent tory government.
1/1	The strange thing is not that Britain is leaving EU - it's that we ever joined.
0/0	The strange thing is that often Leavers are so proud of staying in UK for their holidays they don't even have passports.
0/0	The stupidiest thing Britain has ever done, after picking Giesela Stuart as one of their politicians. Hopefully the negotiations with Britain will fail, so Britain might have a valuable lesson.
1/1	The success of the future global economy will require flexibility, adaptability and control of its own destiny. Brexit gave us everything we needed.
0/-1	The sun has definitely set on the empire...Btw 1:10 was childish
1/1	The tears and whining of Remainers has been beautiful today. You lost, get over it losers
1/-1	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer.
1/1	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer. 'Brexit is completed.
1/1/1	The thing I find really sad about this whole leave v remain is, now that it's happened there are remainers who actually want the country to fail and fall into misery, just so then can turn around and say "told you so". They would somehow see that as a victory, that is beyond sad.
1/1	The thing about paying into the EU budget, we no longer have MEPs, we have left. There is a continuing relationship but significantly different. We should only be paying a small amount into the budget to cover trade continuing currently etc. Not anything like the full payment.
0/0	The thing is that no one is gonna protect them if some country goes to war with them
1/1	The things the European emails were saying is the reason why we left. They don’t get it
0/0	The thought is unbearable. Affecting me badly..Brexiters still have their eyes closed dreaming of sun lut uplands while we'll be isolated & left in some situation like a war zone
0/0	The thought of leaving the EU is keeping me up at night and giving me palpitations. I'm not sure I'm hardy enough to cope with all of this. Please can't we stay in.
0/0/0	The time has come to sit back, and watch Brexit crash and burn.
0/0	The time spent on the two sides of the argument is pretty much representative of each side's argument strengh. From an economic standpoint, if you leave you will destroy your country, so there isn't much to say for Brexit.
1/-1	The tower of Babel will fall.
1/1	The toxic eu is a dictatorship that we voted to leave, thank the heavens
1/1/1/1	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
0/0/0/0/0	The trade deals seem to be a problem. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is another sticky situation. The whole thing doesn't seem like it was well thought out.
1/1	The trade unions used to exist to serve the working class. Now they're in favour of cheap foreign labour and being under the kosh of a corporate/political unelected entity.
0/0	The trend will continue to move in direction of "a rethink" as one by one the ludicrous promises made to the electorate get holes blown through them. The trend willbe reinforced as the UK sinks into prolonged stagnation and the EU economy builds up momentum. It's as if the British millstone has been removed from around the EUs neck and the clouds of negativity created by Brextremists and their Eurosceptic forebears dissipates and gives way to a sunlit upland. The European project will continue and once again the UK will repent having cut its self off from its neighbours. Of course things may not turn out that bad if the UK comes to its senses and stops behaving like a bull In a china shop in its Brexit negotiations. It needs to replace it's Brextremists with shmooztremists.
0/0	The triumph of small minds liars and racists. So much to celebrate!
1/-1	The trouble is that most of us have no clue as to how the Brussels monolith works, or who’s in charge
1/0	The trouble is, Brexit is being fudged by a bunch of bad losers, who are determined to remain in the EU, whatever they say in public.
0/0	The true stupidity of Brexit, it that it is obvious to even the meanest intelligence, that it unwinds a century of civilisation.
0/1	The truth is that protectionism doesn’t benefit anyone but the big companies that are moaning about Brexit.
0/0	The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty
0/1	The truth is that this story of the UK and the rest of Europe has a long history and one thing for sure, it's not about to end. I prefer being a useful member of a society and no nationalities.
1	The truth is there was never any intent on their part to honour the decision to leave. These are grade one A holes we are dealing with.
1/1	The truth is we voted to leave so lets live in a democracy and doit and there is nothing you can say to us that we haven't heard so go on lets make Britain great again or are all you remainers traitors to democracy!!!!!
0	The truth of the matter is if you voted to leave you essentially want to live the rest of your life just surviving and without any ability to build an international business and produce real wealth for yourselves. That or you are over 65 and are deluded by the illusions of nationality and sovereignty.
0/1	The truth of the matter is that Europeans will never be a cohesive union. It is a shame really, but a reality that must be faced head on.
1/1	The two richest countries in Europe arent(wisely) in the E.U.go figure that
0/0	The two things guaranteed to enrage Brexiters and their super childish populism - logic and common sense.
0/0	The two thirds of immigrants are from outside the EU and the government has a full control of the numbers. Why haven't they used their power to do something about it? Now we are leaving the EU and putting hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line.
0/0	The ugly face of Brexit.. racism and xenophobia perceived as acceptable behaviour..
0/0	The uk created this mess, not the eu.
1/1	The uk government is the laughing stock , the uk people want out of a failed globalist rip-off project ; ]
1	The uk had no power over the eu, it did as it liked , it leaked money like it was going out of fashion and was demanding control of member nations, none of that is good.
0/0	The uk is a joke.
1/1	The uk own a third of the world on our own we could do it again
1/0	The uk steals doctors from poorer contries in the EU, these contries need thier doctors, so it would be in the best intrest for the rest of the EU if the UK leaves.
0/0	The uk will suffer a lot because of brexit
1/1	The ultimate goal of the EU is the creation of The United States of Europe. Staying in the EU means the end of the UK, as it would be relegated to nothing more than a district council.
1/1	The undemocratic nature of the EU political union is the clincher for me. Dictatorships never end well, and as a citizen of the country that founded parliamentary democracy, I resent out govt being handed over to an undemocratic foreign power. We do not need to be in a political union to trade with European countries, nor them with us.
0/0	The uneducated, who naturally tend to have the poorest paid jobs, voted en masse to leave. We will have crashed out of the EU and entered a deep and long recession.
1/-1/1	The unelected eu, overturning refererenda until the British said NO!.
1/-1	The unemployed UK worker who will take your place and accommodation will pay the taxes that you pay now and perhaps receive the in-work and housing benefits you receive as well.
0/0	The usual Brexiter delusion.
0/0	The utter ignorance of Brexiteers is staggering. Even now.
0/0	The vast majority of young people in the U.K. (Especially those living in the cities) did not want to leave the EU whereas the vast majority of the older generation did.A bit like middle American Trump voters/middle England Brexit voters.
0/1	The very best deal is a very swift and permanent #exitfrombrexit. We are European and need to remain firmly at the centre of the EU
0	The victory of total idiocy over reason! Sad to attend such events without being able to stop them. Perhaps also in the United States ... I must feel what an educated democrat must have felt in Germany in the 1930s.
1/1	The volume of propaganda and the attempts to keep Britain in the EU via the back door are all factors in producing a poll result which in itself is used as a propaganda item. Check out what just happened in Italy and it reminds us why we need to leave.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The vote for Brexit is a vote against Europeans, against European culture and European values.
1/1	The vote was OUT! Goodbye EU!
1/1	The voters will never forgive you, if you don't deliver BREXIT.
0/1	The votes were fake,people actually wanted to have brexit,people were fooled by the corrupt politicians..
0/0	The voting system is flawed, and this is a perfect example of it. Simply voting 'yes' or 'no' is complete nonsense. People are completely misinformed and unaware of the legal conditions and the consequences accompanying a simple Yes or No.
1/-1	The waitress says that business rates have gone up? That's down to your local council dear and that's been a problem for about 11 years. Absolutely nothing to do with Brexit .
0/0	The war has not been won. A battle has been won. And democracy is the loser.Already looking forward to rubbing brexiteers noses in it when we finally win the war.
1/1	The waters will be stormy in the near term, but with sound navigation, a bright future lies ahead.
1/1	The way I see it, the more governments that exist, the better
1/1	The way the EU is set up is incredible. If we stay in, we will ultimately lose our sovereignty and any meaningful democracy. Yes, we'll still get to vote in elections to make it feel like we're in a democracy, but we won't have any real influence over those who really govern us in Brussels.
1/1	The way the EU works at this point is very undemocratic
1/1	The way the younger generation have been brainwashed in school I can imagine we'll be back in it within 10 years.
1/0/1	The way they behave, I wouldn't want to have a deal with them! No deal sounds good to me!
0/-1	The way we digest our news is changing. Trump goes straight to Twitter, Boris gave his #Brexit speech via Facebook and the established MSM journos aren't happy. Party's over guys, it was fun for you whilst it lasted.
1/1	The weakness is clearly immigration.
0/0	The whole Brexit is absolute waste of time and money (so far £40bln) to appease people (majority of them racists) that can’t be appeased anyway.
0/0	The whole Brexit saga is, in my view, one big, terrifying leap in the dark.
0/0	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job
0/0	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job. They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
1/1	The whole EU will soon fall. That’s what I see watching from America. The EU sucks.
0/0	The whole farcical debacle would be funny , if the whole fiasco wasn't so tragic .
1/-1	The whole furore we hear from the EU is based merely on their fear of losing control - control freaks one and all...
0/0	The whole leave campaign has been based on lies. What absolute charlatans. Why on earth would you trust the Garagistes?
0/0	The whole of UK needs a rude awakening anyway
0/0	The whole of the brexit mess is all planned all along, frustrate it confuse the voters so they want back in.
0/0	The whole point in Brexit was to leave the Eu, now not only are we not leaving the Eu but we're losing right to have a say in the Eu. No matter how you look at this it's bad for Remainers and Leavers.
0/1	The whole referendum was a fucking bailout to a Tory party that would rather gamble with the future of the country and stay in power rather than lose gracefully.
1/1	The whole rotten corrupt system will soon collapse thank god we are out June 23rd our Independence Day
0/-1	The whole thing is a f***-up, from start to f***. We have no negotiating position. The EU has a negotiating position, it’s this: “Well, f*** off then!
0/0/0	The whole thing is just so unpatriotic. Trump and Putin are rejoicing. We've stuck a knife in the heart of the most peaceful and forward-thinking alliance in the world, in which we were a leading voice and power. We were winning as a nation, people wanted to join our society and way of life. It's the frightened ones that couldn't get their head around change so just wanted to shut the door that are unpatriotic and have let down the country. It's not much of a stretch to say the UK (led by the Tories) have done a pretty shameful act.
0/1	The whole thing is the fault of Brexiteers
1/1	The widespread British view of the backstop shows a deep distrust of EU institutions and their role in protecting the interests of member states and maintaining a level playing field.
0/0	The withdrawal agreement is dead in the water and cannot be reopened. An extension of Article 50 is likely to be thwarted by the likes of Poland, potentially, and Spain if they don’t get their way over Gibraltar. Crashing out on March 29th would be obviously catastrophic economically. Worth noting that a large number of major businesses set up in the UK because it was in the EU. Many would clearly move out if the UK crashes out resulting in huge job losses.
0/0	The words of a leaver shocked me thoroughly this morning! Blaming the consequences of their own vote on the EU! Leavers, wake up and realise that this is the reality of what you voted for. If we leave the EU we are no longer in a position to benefit from what they have to offer if we do not contribute. You can not have it both ways!
1/1	The working class of this country should remember as long as we have open borders your wages will be suppressed the last 10 years has proved that
0/1	The world IS still VERY divided. Which is why Brexit, and the whole idea of 'focusing inward' and trying to alienate things is just going to make it worse. Which is pretty much what the main people who voted Brexit (That i know/speak to personally) wanted, tehy wanted us more closed off and removing 'foreign' things from 'our culture' rather than embracing more and joining others.
1/1	The world is fed up with this extremely boring Brexit saga. Get it done and move on, please.
0/0/0/0/0	The world is safer with the European Union. Assuming the EU stays together, I give it 20 years until Britain wants back in.
1/1	The world outside Europe - The Real World would love to see you throw off the shackles of a moribund misplaced European experiment. You have so much to gain by taking back the helm of your own ship of destiny. Cast off the stiltifying straight-jacket of Brussel's control. Then you can get your house in order, contol your borders, decide who you want to live amongst you and start trading with The Commonwealth progressively again and put the GREAT back into Britain again. Other, commonsense nations will follow you, like Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway you could even reform EFTA again. Go on, You know you Want To.
0/0	The world will roll over puny UK. You think the trade giants like the US and China will make better deals with you than the biggest trade block in the world : the European Union? Numbers count!
0/0	The worlds gone crazy haha, we are one big meme
0/0/0	The worry is that now that the EU doesn’t protect us any more, America will walk all over us. We will become the 52nd state (‘israel’ is the 51st) and that will be disastrous.
0/0	The worst aspect of #brexit is not economic, it is the empowerment of the dregs of society and the 'normalisation' of their rancid identity politics.
0/0	The worst part is how incompetent and misinformed/deluded our own government is dealing with Brexit. They are clueless and are just riding on a wave of optimism and patriotism. It will and is crashing and burning and we are only a month into the Brexit process.
0/0	The worst part of this is the complete lack of rational logic-based debate in politics, all replaced by vacuous slogans, lies and scaremongering. Brexit has taken on a cult-like status, to be dogmatically believed regardless of cost. Something like the flat earth society or creationism springs to mind... No basis in common sense or logical thought..
0/0	The younger the individual, the more likely they voted Remain. It's time for Remainers to look around and determine if maybe their future lies on the continent. Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona and so many other cities big and small will welcome you. Brexit is going to have long-term negative consequences for Britain but the people who voted for it will be either dead or enjoying their retirement checks for it to make a difference to them. Come live in a country where the Murdoch media machine doesn't exist. You won't regret it.
0/0	The youth of Spain are not against the E.U. They do not blame the E.U., but the Spanish government. You know nothing about Spain and continental Europe.
1/1	The “people” have already had their say and they chose to leave!
1/-1	The “perfect skills storm” was an issue way before Brexit was on the table so don’t give me that nonsense.
0/0	Their economy will crash simultaneously with ours. Putin must be getting tired of celebrating.
0	Their economy will suffer massively.
1/1	Their loss not ours. Rule Britannia!
1/1	Their not called refuges their called economic migrants. The people who are coming to places like Germany are going for the fact that they can just sit on befits and make kids. The real refuges go to the nearest country to them NOT to the uk.
0/0	Theiridea of courtesy is constant threats. Out of EU Titanic.
0/0	Then we should have it so, should we not? After all the Only thing Brexit will do is ... Make the Rich-Richer and the Poor-Poorer. All of Our Human Rights will be a Distant Memory as will Our Precious NHS and Our Infrastructure too.
0/0	Theory shouldn’t really as that will backfire tremendously bad for the British economy. Most likely it will also bring with it a new referendum to Scottish independence as most Scotish seem to be pro EU.
0/0	There are 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who are still qualified to apply, and may be sick of being discriminated against.
0/0	There are 48% of us who voted against this shit
1/1	There are 6.5 BILLION other people to do business with other than the E.U...
0/0	There are SO many problems ministers should be getting on with right now - the climate emergency, our housing crisis and fixing Universal Credit, to name but a few. But trying to deliver May’s dangerous, blindfold #Brexit has brought the work of government to a standstill.
0/0	There are aren't any Muslim EU countries
0/0	There are brexiters complaining about  people coming from Kenya to our country on stolen EU passports is somehow the EU's fault!! Come on brexiters, get some sense of reality!
1/1/1	There are many dangers Britain may yet face, but it will be all the better for facing them as a free, independent, and self-governing nation.
0/0	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications
0/0/0/0	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications.
1/1	There are many potential positives, not to mention the fact that Brexit has really got government and business thinking about how the UK can boost exports and become more competitive.
1/1	There are more risks staying in the EU (more bailouts, more immigration of UNSKILLED workers etc.)
0/0	There are no benefits of leaving the EU without a deal.
0/0	There are no good personal Brexit stories. And there won't be any
0/0	There are no opportunities of Brexit, zilch, none, nothing, how can you expect any normal person to embrace a deluded fantasy?
0/0	There are over 3 million peoples who work, pay taxes and live in UK and you just "forgot" to ask them if they want brexit. They are EU citizens. Do you still think you won the referendum?
0/0/0	There are plenty of people who voted to stay in the EU who don’t have degrees. The problem with trying to articulate the reasons for voting leave is that there aren’t any, the leave campaign was solely based on meaninglessness slogans and emotion - not facts.
0/0	There are so many similarities between Brexitors & Trump voters. Their anger can not be extinguished even when they get what they want.
0/0	There are some really nasty people in the Tory party. And this guy is one of the nastiest!
0/0	There are times when I fervently wish Britain would exit the EU because I would love to hear the Eurosceptics arguments when it finally dawned on them that the EU was not responsible for the UK's dire housing problem, its creaking NHS and lack of social mobility thanks to a two-tier education system that works against the poor.
1/1	There are too many restrictions in EU law. The huge EU regulatory system limits the free trade agreements between the UK and other countries such as China, India and the United States, as well as the UK industry. After leaving the EU, the UK can avoid these regulations and better prepare for long-term economic benefits.
0/0	There are uncountable benefits of being in the EU. One is the unprecedented level afforded by the freedom of movement rules for EU citizens, which over a million Brits are benefiting from right now.
0/0	There are undiscovered Amazonian tribes who have done more to prepare for Brexit than we have.
0/0	There are zero upsides to Brexit. No dividend. Only massive downsides, economic damage and other losses, alongside years of turmoil as we work to renegotiate 45 years' worth of trade agreements. It staggers me that people can be so ignorant and naive. I see there's now a propaganda campaign underway on social media, spreading egregious lies about the future of the EU, in preparation for a 2nd ref
0	There can be no "healing process" when people have had their futures stolen from them by liars and cheats.
0/0	There can be no orderly exit because Brexit is fundamentally nuts. You can't apply ordered thinking to something which is actually insane
0/0	There goes car manufacturing, fish and farm exports. I am sure those little Brexit towns that relied on these industries will be very happy with it. Their Happy Brexit day celebration in 2021 will surely be out of this world.
1/-1	There has always been a slightly anti Britain whiff about the EU.
1/1	There has been a total concerted effort by all areas of the media to savage the Brexiteers views. We have faced biased accounts and I am disheartened by some politicians who have no confidence in the British people to go it alone. Why do some people still need to take rules and orders from the EU? British politicians need to begin to think for themselves and not rely on unelected bureaucrats.
0/0	There hasn't been any economic think tank who expects a prosperous outcome out of Brexit.
0/1	There have been mistakes, decisions that were wrong, and yes, they are the establishment and the system requires dramatic change. Which is what should be our goal
1/1	There is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country.
0/0	There is a lot you can do as united but not lonely
1/-1	There is an urgent need for British business and civil society, of course to reengage with us and we hope they will do that, and we expect they will
1/1	There is going to be a lot of trouble unless the Brexit we voted for is delivered. It was a BINARY choice, stay or leave. Not leave in name only. This will be the end of the Tories if the vinegar titted one is not careful and the LAST thing we want is comrade Steptoe running the show.
0/1	There is huge danger in having non-elected administrators in Brussels dictate all aspects of peoples lives
0/-1	There is huge inequality in the EU. Bulgaria uses horse drawn carts. Poland has abysmally low wages. This goes on. British companies love this
0/0	There is no Armageddon after Brexit. Just more poverty and secession movement.s Another proof that humans are irrational.
0/0	There is no `coming together' , I want to disassociate completely from Brexiteers and everything they represent.
0/0	There is no country on the planet that has less right to complain about immigration then England. They literally invaded every continent on the planet
1/1	There is no democracy in the EU. They openly admit it. And still people want to remain.
1/0	There is no doubt that a Brexit will cause economic and political pain, any suggestion to the contrary is foolhardy
0/-1/0	There is no evidence for this madness. There is no way some notional boost in trade with China or the US can compensate for what “hard” Brexit would cost the economy.
1/1	There is no f**king EU money!!! It's taken from us each year and then half is returned to us with conditions attached to how it is spent. Oh, and we have to be grateful to them!
0/1	There is no good reason why Britain can't run a viable independent trade policy but for one. Britain will be hopelessly outclassed because policy is directed by Tory fantasists who prefer their tribal fiction to the cold reality of our predicament.
1/-1	There is no guarantee that the trend will continue but what we do need to understand is that it is being driven by Brexit
1/1	There is no law that says we must pay 39 billion. We don't need Europe and it's time to leave
1/-1	There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules."
0/0	There is no plan for making Brexit work. Brexit was a project that was weaponised by Boris johnson to become PM, now that he has finally succeeded, he's boxed himself in. His whole credibility now rests on making a success of what was always a wild gamble based on nothing but grandstanding, thin air, and the backing of one maverick economist (Minford) who nevertheless admitted that 'Brexit will decimate agriculture and manufacturing in the UK' and he said that as if it was a good thing.
1/1	There is no price that is compared to freedom and independence. So Leave is better
0/0	There is no question in my mind that a 'Brexit' would deal a significant blow to the E.U.'s strength and resilience at exactly the moment when the West is under attack from multiple directions.
1/1	There is no reason why we cannot become Western version of Hong Kong or Singapore (I wonder where they learned their commercial expertise from?).
1/1	There is no such thing as a “No Deal”. It’s a Brexit Deal. It’s a democratic deal. It’s an independence deal. The No Deal is a EU con trick a Theresa May created scaremongering.
1/1	There is not going to be another referendum. It is simply out of the question. We are leaving the EU and there is nothing anybody can do about it.
0/-1	There is nothing illegal about the EU flag, as in fact it is the flag of the Council of Europe....which a) the EU adopted and b) the UK will be remaining a member of..... Fly the flag
0/0	There is nothing wrong - for the UK- in being in the EU ! It does us great economic good and little harm.
0/0	There is one simple reason Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK. And that is the fact that the EU has to punish the UK. If the UK does well out of Brexit, other members are going to think leaving is a good idea. Poland, France, Italy... Support for leaving the EU will rise. But if Brexit is disaster and the UK gets screwed, other countries will think twice about leaving. The UK is already going, so there's no reason for the EU to make the deal favorable to the UK. Its in the EU's interest to screw the UK. So they will.
1/1	There is only one poll worth considering, the Referendum we had in 2016.
0/0	There is only one sure fire-way to solve the crisis - that is to REMAIN! This whole Brexit thing is completely and utterly ridiculous!
0/1	There is only one thing taking off the table. BREXIT
1/1	There is only one way to get the change we need - and that is to vote to go!
0/0	There is simply no reason to assume the that final phase of Brexit preparation will be governed by reason, measured calculation and an outbreak of common sense - none at all. The Brexit debacle was based on lies, tory in-fighting and deluded beliefs about Britains position in the world. The only thing May seems capable of is incompetence not that this disturbs the political outlook of those who believe in unicorns or greater banana freedoms.
1/-1	There is the EU and then there is the European project. The European project of integration continues regardless of the fate of the EU
0/0	There isn’t much that’s funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha.
0/0	There isn’t one single tangible benefit to #Brexit, other than to tax avoiders.
1/0	There it is. All the people who think Europe owes us anything need to watch this and then choke on their own narcissism.
0/0	There may be some benefits, but personally and individually, we will be worse off
0/0	There might be a few problems missing from the article but those listed should be enough to make any sensible person consider wanting to and how to put a stop to this nonsense before things get really messy.
1	There needs no debate , we had a referendum , we voted out , we cant get a decent deal so we must leave on WTO rules . Nothing further needs to be debated . Any other outcome is not honoring the democratic vote .
0/0	There never should have been a referendum (Cameron only called it to squeak back into power
1	There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream.
1/1	There never was supposed to be a deal we voted out that’s democracy
0/0	There really is nothing to celebrate.
1/1	There seems to be little doubt that the overall British economy will be stronger after BREXIT, although there will naturally be momentary disruption.
1/1/1	There seems to be some part of 'Independent Sovereign Nation' that the EU doesn't understand. Until they stop trying to treat us as some kind of semi-detached member, this is going nowhere.
0/1	There should be an independent legal inquiry regarding the highjack of Brexit by this government. This isn’t democracy it’s a subversion of democratic law. At what point did Mrs May change her mind after she stood there and addressed the nation on live tv and said Brexit means Brexit no deal? Has she been blackmailed and influenced by £££, (foreign) or domestic subjects unknown? Blackmailing, influencing or bribing a sitting prime minister or accepting or giving political favours at a later date surely must be illegal? Somewhere along the way her whole attitude and her narrative to a no deal changed. The question has to be asked in parliament.
1/1	There should be no remoaners in government, they all need to be removed from office!
1/1	There shouldn't be foreign people in the UK
1/1	There used to be a big benefit in agreeing on a telecoms or utility directive in the EU, but nowadays there is not much to be gained. So being in, doesn't have that big benefits.
1/1	There was NEVER any intention by the EU dictatorship to give the UK a deal as they don't want other countries to leave when they see the whole of the UK prosper outside of the Failing corrupt,unelected EU
1/0	There was a democratic vote - just as there was when we went in. I voted no to joining - I lost - I accepted it. I voted yes to leaving - now the remainers need to accept that!
0/0	There was a former great nation now sanctioning itself in favor of a set of illusions never woven before in history.
1/-1	There was a majority to leave. Seems that is the one that counts.
1/1	There was a result. And the result should be accepted.
1/1	There wasn't the option of voting for a deal, it was simply stay in or leave the EU, those were the only 2 choices we were given, it's not rocket science so why all the fuss about some deal ?, Let's just leave and wing it.
0/0	There will also be a simultaneous economic fallout to cope with
0/0	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK. So be prepared to be eating out of bins
0/0	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK. So be prepared to be eating out of bins. Boris Johnson is a YANK.
0/0	There will be a lot of very dissatisfied brexiteers within 5 years once the reality hits their miserable life's that nothing has improved and they are just poorer which is even admitted by their own governments assessments. Happy brexit suckers
0/0	There will be a tremendous brain drain. The Brexiters will get the reversal of net migration they wish for.
1/1	There will be far more problems if we DON'T leave the EU.
1/1/1	There will be little left of the EU in 20 years time.
0/0	There will be many more reasons not to vote Tory if a "no deal" is allowed. Supermarkets, the nuclear industry, hospitals and Pharmaceuticals, the vehicle and manufacturing Industries and shipping are all in panic mode. Even Finance, arguably the one area modern Britain leads the world, is opening up scores of facilities in 3 European capitals and Frankfurt.
1/1	There will be no EU Dictatorship in the future watch we are number 1 domino. Thank you to everyone who has put the Great back into Britain.
1/1	There will be no benefits in the short term, but in the long term, the UK will come out smelling like a rose.
0/0	There will be no economic success.
1/1	There will be no endless delay of respecting people's will. They did not vote for a dealed Brexit, but simply to get of of the EU. The parliament has had two years for the procedure. Now it's enough!
0/-1/0	There will be no force or desire to make Brexit successful. Most Brexiteers are about to die or retire. And the other younger half of the country wants that Brexit fails and the UK to rejoin the EU.
1/1	There will be no recession if we leave the EU. We will be in charge of our own economy.
1/1	There will be other countries, like America,that will make good deals with Great Britain after Brexit.
1/1	There will likely be some pain involved, but in the end the British people will now have a much bigger say in what happens in their own country.
0/0/0	There will not be any going back in the foreseeable future. Britain will have to obey the same way as Norway and Switzerland to get access to the singel market. All other thoughts are just wishful thinking.
0/1	There won’t be an EU for the UK to rejoin. There may be a trading bloc, like the EEC, but the attempt to federalise the countries of Europe into a Franco-German superstate have failed – the EU as it is now will collapse within a decade.
0/0	There's a deep gulf between the right wing hard brexiters in the tory party and reality.
1/1	There's a healthy spin on this one Vox. All of the negatives about leaving the EU but none of the positives besides less immigrants? A lot of media is only presenting one side of the story here.
1/0	There's a little rat bag roaner that keeps leaving these 'BOLLOX TO BREXIT' stcikers around, more so on a life boey. I always rip them down but Monday night, thought I'd 'edit it'. Come back last night, another sticker so i 'edited' that too Seems that I'm not the only on, I saw another too that have been ripped up in the same way.
0/0	There's a word for THIS. And the word is DELUSION!
0/0	There's millions of us. We're regrouping. We remain proEuropean. The country will not unite. All you had to do was keep the Brexiteers to their campaign promises and there would have been no argument. But you fucked up with WTO.
1/0	There's more opportunities in my arse.
1/1	There's no confusion we voted out and all these remainers come back with is project fear over and over again, lets leave on WTO rules and prove them wrong. WTO OVER AND OUT.
1/1	There's nothing wrong or racist with wanting our British sovereignty. I'm half black and voted leave.
1/1	There's nothing wrong with Brexit, it is great for the UK.
1/1	There's only one kind of brexit, the one that won the referendum, so get it done.leave means leave.
1/0	There's the egregious EU copyright directive, which will stifle freedom of speech, and the UK is not going to implement it.
0/1	There's too much to lose for those drunk on low interest rates, addicted to cheap labour, and infantilised by meddlesome government (pro-actively supporting bubbles, the buy-to-let market, and business, through myriad benefits)
1/1	There, now stop scaremongering and raise a glass to Brexit!
0/0	There. Is. No. #Brexit. Opportunity…it is a mythic and made up as unicorns, magic beans , Hogwarts, Middle Earth or Liam Fox’s trade deals. And saying it in a Spectator Leader doesn’t make it any less fantastical.
0/0	There. Is. No. Brexit.
1/1	Therefore, I support Brexit. Europe is becoming weaker and weaker every next day. Under german dictatorship, Europe will end up in bin
0/1/1	Theresa May is Britain's Obama, a failure and a disgrace.
1/1	Theresa May is actually damaging the country. Typical Remainer.
1/1	Theresa May is arrogant. The people has spoken and they want Brexit and not a deal. She wants the deal because she still wants to be with the European Union
0/0	Theresa May seems to be on a suicide mission & she’s taking us with her... 🤦🏼
1/0	Theresa May’s attempt to rescue the Withdrawal Agreement will almost certainly fail. As March 29th draws near both she and Brussels will need to accept a series of smaller agreements to ensure a smooth departure from the EU
0/-1	Theresa Treasonous Incompetent Liar Kick The Can May and her cabinet of clowns, what a joke they all are. Any one who votes for Mays treasonous deal is out of their minds and a traitor to their own country.
1/1	Theresa may was a useless home secretary and it continues
0/0	There’s a connection between the Trump treason and the Brexit - I’ll call that treason too. It’s Wikileaks and Russia’s use of Wikileaks to warp public opinion. I’ve seen photos of Nigel Farage at the front door of that same embassy.
0/0	There’s several facts. Leave lied, consistently. Leave is trying to shift blame. Leave can’t take responsibility. The EU didn’t vote for brexit. And if you want to talk about communication, please refer to the Express and get back to me.
1/1	These EU bullies just trying to make life hard for the British, when will we just tell them to do one, hang on a minute....
1/1	These EU leaders are just a bunch of bullies . Scared that others will follow the UK example and leave. They may be saying non, non, non. but their tune may change if we withhold the billions they want? What can they do - take us to a court that we are saying will no longer have jurisdiction over us? Stick with it Mrs May. There will be something that they have forgotten about that they need which may break their stance.
0	These Pro-Brexit people have empire on the brain. Those days are gone.
0/0	These are the kind of people who voted for Brexit. They do not represent 'the will of the British people' they represent the will of fascism and racial hatred.
0/-1	These are the lying Facebook ads Dominic Cummings used in 2016. Why is no newspaper RIPPING APART the lies
0/0	These are the sunny uplands brexiteers dream of. Why not enjoy them as part of the EU?
1/1	These hundreds of regulations are a huge burden on small businesses and each one comes with threats of punishment by way of fines of thousands of pound
0/0/0	These idiots will be sorry when the food price will be increasing and they cannot longer travel freely. Remember the rich will never have the problems
1/1	These interviews are clearly to mess up the Brexit! It’s all lies!!!
1/1	These member countries lost sovereignty and to me that's never a good thing.
0/0	These old Brexiters don't have an economic clue and not that bothered either as they're all on pension. To them it's all about migrants. Unfortunately on day 1 of Brexit our French chums boot our customs men out from Calais allowing all the Sangate flotsam to come across the channel. Being soft in the head, we'll allow them to stay while we 'process' them.That means they're here forever - Dover becomes the new Sangate, little England putters on and slips down the economic rankings until departing the Top 10 economies a decade later. Brexiters all dead by that stage so they don't give a damn about the mess they've made.
1/0	These people are idiots, just get out already.
1/0	These remainers have no respect for the people. Leave means leave.
1/1	These ridiculous indy polls are just lapped up here,but as a proud brexiter and trump supporter,Ive gloated on here forever it seems,it will be magnificent when he is a two term president.Donald will probably offer Tommy political asylum where he will be free of persecution.
1/1	These self elected Rats in the EU Will not listen to anyone .Why should they ?They are the Dictators of EU .No one is allowed to tell the EU Rats in Parliament what to do .So dont pay a penny walk away now .No more idle chit chat
1/-1	These so many dislikes by people from EU members.
0	They all acting like we was gonna float off into space!
1/1	They are afraid that will will be much more competitive. Which we can be now we have left .
1/1	They are better off if they exit
1/1	They are finally independent
1/1	They are going for a second referendum to keep us captured in the spider's web for good!
1/1	They are insisting on the backstop to prevent us leaving.
1/1	They are just holding us to ransom,...and we are giving in to them because there is no one with the guts of Nigel Farage to tell them to shove their deal up where the sun don't shine,.....just leave and save the 39 BILLION pounds that we will have to pay, if we stay,....they are broke, and in a bad way, they will really miss this payment.... plus...we buy much more from them than they do from us.....don't listen to the doom spreaders ....they have been wrong so far so just leave.
1/1	They are not immigrants they are migrants. Immigrants leave a society and join a different one adopting the new society as their own and obey it's laws. Migrants invade and attempt to replace a society. If British people believe their identity is worth preserving they should want sovereignty and vote leave. If you're fine with converting to Islam then vote stay.
1/0	They are now beginning to understand what Brexit means to them. They need us more than we need them. Perhaps in retrospect they should have listened to Cameron more and not laughed at the UKs requests.
1	They are only Interested in our money as we are the second highest payers into the EU.xx
1/1	They are only upset coz they are not gonna get all the money the British government sends them I can see other European country's going next when they realise how much money their country's could save
1/1	They are out to make an example of the UK as a warning to any other countries who may also harbour a desire to leave
1/1	They are petrified that more countries will leave once they see the U.K. doing well.
0/-1	They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US
0/0/0	They are singing Land of Hope and Glory over the road. Says it all - a delusional sense of national importance predominantly among the older, tabloid reading populace, has enabled a grasping billionaire elite to manipulate swathes of the electorate to bring us to this pass. Singing songs from a previous century, as if to bring back Empire (as opposed to selling us all down the river).
0/0/0	They are truly fucked. The break up of the union is on its way and all because of the English voters, hoping to return to the old empire.
0/0	They aren't foreigners, they are fellow Europeans.
1/-1	They aren't going to win. The Torries will win, as always and this whole thing will be for naught. It's so embarrassing the way UK lawmakers cannot accept the referendum and carry it out. Don't ask the people for their opinion if you are just going to ignore it because it's "too hard".
0/-1	They belong to Europe like Austria, Belgium & Cyprus!
0/0	They better worry about Ireland
1/1	They big problem is that the EU expanded too far, too soon. This is where the problems with immigration come into play. When it was a smaller union, the MS had similar GDP's. Now that several, relatively poor, Eastern European states have joined, of course there has been mass immigration.
1/0/1	They buy the propaganda that Britain will fall over and die if they don't give up their right to rule their own lands and keep sending money to be wasted across Europe.
0/0	They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
0/0	They couldn't get any support for BREXIT until they framed it as an immigration issue (sound familiar?) The Southern Strategy: "Convince the majority that someone is getting something that they feel entitled to and you can pick their pockets. Convince the majority that the person receiving a benefit is a person of color and they will empty their pockets for you".Russia has capitalized on the majority's fear and disdain of people of color all over the world.
0/-1	They decided it was better to yell at those pointing out the reality, than acknowledge what was happening around them. The goal posts were moved from glorious future to "it's not a disaster yet".
0/0	They deserve nothing more than what they voted for. They should all lose their jobs that were created only because of EU
1/1	They did NOT vote for a DEAL, they voted to LEAVE.
1/1	They did it. I am definitely skeptical of the European Union so I'm not shedding a tear. I don't agree with how they are doing it but that's their business. People who were opposed to Brexit have nobody to blame but the opposition. The complete inability of opposition parties to unify instead of political grandstanding was hilarious. This decision was made by Labour, the Lib-Dems, and SNP as much as it was made by the Tories.
1/1/1	They did the right thing
1/0	They didn't know what they left'' don't chat shite mate
0/1	They didn't seem confused. They wanted to LEAVE!
1/1/1	They didn't tell you Brexit would be dropped into hibernation for years did they? Been like trying to squeeze a Brexit peg into a Remainers square hole since.
0/0	They don't have staff to fill the shelves in my local supermakets already. Whole sections are being left empty. Where are the British workers leave.eu promised?
1/1	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch
1/1	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch.
1/0	They don't want a deal, they want a cash cow to fund their failing dictatorship.
0/-1	They eat each other alive. The English are ruthless. The U.S congress looks like a bunch of pansies compared to them.
1	They finally got the message. Happy brexit day
0/-1	They forgot something essential: British citizens will no longer be EU citizens.
1/-1	They gambled. And the end result? Al 'Boris' Johnson with an 80 seat majority.
1/1	They get to control their own destiny regarding foreign policy currency and immigration
0/0/-1	They got here because people fell for the lies of Charlatan Farage and filthy toilet paper The Sun. That's how dumb it is.
1/1	They have all been our historic enemies at some point in time, and it looks like most of them still are.
1/1	They have been in positions of power where they could have stood up for the British, but like all the other pro-EU parties just carried on.
1/1	They have had 3.5 years. Do you seriously think Europe wants to lose that massive car industry trade. Try to be serious for once MSM instead of whipping up hysteria.
1/0	They have lost their second biggest net contributor which is equal to 19 EU27 members combined and 16% of the EU economy simply because they were too arrogant to give Cameron even modest concessions.
0/1	They have only just left after listening to it for years so let’s not start another few years of counting down their rejoining.
0/0	They have spent 40 years blaming the EU for everything from unaffordable housing (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country) to overcrowded roads (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country). That isn’t going to stop. In fact, if anything, TBF, it will be funny to hear them go on (and on, and on...) blaming the EU for their own mess as the country continues to go down the pan.
1/1	They have taken a demand to give up our 10% say in the EU and retrieve our 100% sovereignty over the UK, and managed to turn it into a ‘deal’ which gives up both.
0/0	They have voted for people to be worse off, they have voted for people to lose their jobs, to lose their homes, to struggle to pay their bills, to make raising their children harder
1/1/0	They just got out in time, the EU is going to be the biggest distaster EVER. Yes, the EU will be the next major power due to their economy, but they will be warring with the US over economic and political reasons. Just wait when Russia joins up with them.
1/1	They keep telling us what we can't have because we won't be in the club, then they tell us we've got to follow their rules even when out of the club. They want it all, tell them where to go Boris
0/0	They know #Brexit will be a huge failure, but if the EU collapses they can then say we were right to leave anyway. They want the UK and the EU to fail. It will please their paymasters - Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
1/-1	They left cos EU is banning memes
0/0	They lied to the people when they said Brexit is easy. Since the result was very close – 51.9 vs. 48.1% - I’m almost certain that enough people would vote differently today to stop this madness, now knowing some of the negative consequences
0/-1	They may not get screwed. They may be dead before the worst of it. You know, the same plan for the past few decades regarding the environment?
1/1	They must back down and they will. They always do. We should have played hardball from the start. Once they know Hard Brexit is on the table, they will dance to a different tune.
1/1	They need us more than we need them, spineless negotiation, just walk away and watch Italy and Greece take back their sovereignty too...
0/0	They only care about the leavers, why? Remainers should have a voice too.
1/0	They really aren't trying to let us part on good terms. How can anyone negotiate a deal with someone like this
1/0	They sang a Scottish song on purpose. This institution is not a friend to the wider UK or any other country that goes against it.
1/-1	They seem to be getting on fine with the EU -> UK talks just fine without Ireland there…you think they could have at least super-imposed Leo or Simon in the photo to help with the election campaign
0/0	They seem to think of this as vindication of their position when in reality it is an irrelevant surrogate for the Brexit benefits that don’t exist. If I ever see a tangible positive for Brexit, I’ll acknowledge it.
1/1	They shall leave. They are too “empiristic”. They think that they are alone. Keep them alone. This is, when one doesn’t fit into a group.
1/-1	They should all be deported,we cannot afford them.
1/1	They should have thought of all this before they joined the shitty Eu
0/0	They sing for their deal, not real Brexit. They are stealing the money of British people.
1/1/0	They talk like there won’t be any immigration after brexit. We can let in as many people as we need after brexit.
1/1/1/-1	They told Globalism to go to hell! Good!
1/1	They took their country back from the EU and we're taking ours back from the socialists in November!
1/1	They used Britain for tax reasons now these big companies want out before inland revenue start asking questions.
0/0	They voted Leave so they must want economic destruction and poverty.
1/1	They voted the right way. We do NOT want to be part of this totally corrupt, EU Nazi dictatorship. Only Big Business wants to make it easy on themselves, and they are willing to kill off British democracy to get their way. We must fight these Vile EU Nazi lovers in our country.
1/1	They voted to LEAVE the EU, so LEAVE. Its that simple.
0/0	They voted to leave! Lmfaoooo
1/1/1	They voted to remain so they could keep their boyfriends here, that's all.
0/0	They want the benefits from the European Union, but they don't want to invest in the European Union.
0/0	They watched our country install Trump we get to watch them do this. Both huge stupid moves.
1/0	They were right to leave the EU however. What was once a good idea has morphed into a wasteful bureaucratic cesspool with faceless bureaucrats that interferes far too much in peoples lives and national sovereignty. they hate the idea of national votes and have crippled the poorest in society. Now in the weeks ahead will come the avalanche of other countries looking to leave this failing political union. Anti EU sentiment is greater in France than in the UK, There are calls for an immediate referendum in Denmark anti EU sentiment is on the rise all over Europe and this is the beginning of the end for the EU s we know it now.Greece will need yet another bailout next month, portugal and Spain are not far behind and the eurozone’s third biggest economy Italy is under serious pressure. All of these problems existed before BREXIT. Now watch how the central bankers will try to pin all these issues on britain leaving the EU. These issues existed long before any referendum and are largely down tho the euro/Ecb.
0/-1	They were told that there would be a bonfire of regulations, and that was seen as a good thing. I could never understand why.
0/0	They were too frightened to let us have a second referendum because they knew they would lose hands down. Why leave our European friends?
0/0	They will be happy until they have no jobs and no income. If they are pensioners and when the banks relocate to Frankfurt and then close, they won't get their pensions.
0/0	They will never, ever take responsilbity for brexit being a failure. It'll be remainer saboteurs who didn't get behind Britain, or drunken Junker and the EUSSR refusing us a deal, or any other scapegoat. They will never accept that they are wrong. It's always going to be someone else's fault.
0/0	They will pay a heavy price for listening to the lies that brought them to this.
0/-1	They will reach a trade deal, very late in the day, when German Industrial Muscle gets Barnier replaced by someone who puts jobs before the European Project and the particular interests of French fishermen.
0/-1	They will realize that they stand without and trade deal with the EU, and after slamming the door leaving EU, the chance for any EU country will forget and make a new deal is small.
0/0	They will still be miserable hedge, pothole, noise complainers in the morning. Soon the deep realisation will set in, it wasn't the EU making their lives miserable. EU was propping up a country living a lie.
1/1	They will struggle in the beginning as they get their sea legs, but just like when US declared its independence from Britain, so to Britain will succeed in their national freedom.
1/0	They will want to join back in 3 years...
1/1	They won't have to take in so many migrants once they leave. This is good for them.
0	They won't take responsibility. Guess who they will blame....... the B foreigners. It will NEVER BE their fault.
0/0/0	They wont have a chance without the rest of Europe ....
1/1	They'll be fine, Switzerland isn't in is in the EU. Go ahead look up how good Switzerland is doing.
0/0	They'll get exactly what they voted for twice. Not what they wanted, but what they voted for.
1/1	They'll have to start raiding their piggy banks when we leave and they can't use us as a cash cow any more!
0/0	They'll sit back and just let the UK screw itself over and then cave. It's worked so for them so far. They've got everything they've wanted to date and they know Johnson says one thing, swears to do it then caves. They know we've followed the emptiest of people.
0/0	They're going to regret it.
0/-1	They're not wrong. Been saying it since she embraced Brexit so eagerly.
1/1	They're still trying to dictate to us , even though we're now out.
1	They're still trying to kill Brexit and gave the country to the EU in an even worse arrangement than the one we voted to leve. It's just disgraceful, actual treason right under our noses
0/0	They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
1/1	They've got their confrontation and conflict.
1/-1	They've had over 40 years to 'sort shit out' why now are they making promises now if we stay in #BBCDebate #LittleTooLate #VoteLeave
1/1	They've had two years to prepare for a no deal ffs and they haven't done nothing !!!! What is the matter are they unable to do it or is it because they have no intention in leaving the EU !!!!
1/0/0	They’ll be back. It may take a generation but they will be back.
0/0	They’ll need more than luck.
1/1	They’re trying to hold our country hostage! I say we call their bluff! #NoDeal time to walk away and protect our sovereignty!
0/0/0	Thick as shit. Sorry but it's quite obvious these morons have no idea what they voted for
0/0	Thick. Shame on the English
1/1	Think big and leave the EU
0/0/0	Think the U.K. going break up shame took few bigots to ruin a nation shame but hey that’s what those Brexiters deserve if that happens.
0/0	Think we should vote again on brexit most people did not know what thay was voting
0/0	This ! EU just got massively cheaper cars. Post-Brexit our cars selling into EU will be tariff-laden while Japanese ones will not !
1/1	This #referendum is the patriots of the working class v big businesses and treasonous unhinged traitors! Which one are you? #VoteLeave
0/0	This BREXIT deal was brokered and approved by England's very own United King-Dumb Boris Johnson. Looking forward to seeing Scotland break away so they can broker their own deal with the EU. FREEDOM...from The King-DUMB!!!
0/0	This Brexit WANT TRUMP and his crime FRIENDS
0/0	This Brexit shitshow is going to cause so much pain.
1/-1	This Buffoon is only good at talking and rarely stick to his words.
0/0	This Hard Right Tory government can’t wait to Strip us of the Human Rights Act.. they are falling over themselves over the point of being able to do it.. Then they can get away with Murder... over 130’000 Sick and Disabled dead in the last 10 years, think of the number of us Disabled who will be a Target for them if they get rid of the human rights act....
0/-1	This Irish woman will have to eat her words when Ireland votes YET AGAIN to leave and Varadkar is history! Free Ireland.â˜˜ï¸
1/1	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation.
1	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation. Maybe one day, Europe will change its behavior. TRUMP for British Prime Minister!!!
0/-1	This ain’t over. Get Teresa May the hell out and reload. Nigel will blow the lid off.
1/1	This all boils down to the fact that the EU does not favour competition. It wants to ensure that there is none. This is proved by the fact that it wants to prevent its biggest export market having a successful economy by refusing a reasonable trade deal because that market might become too competitive. No country would ever demonstrate such stupidly, only an undemocratic bureaucracy unanswerable to its own people.
0/0	This all reminds me of that last scene in Finding Nemo, where the fish in plastic bags finally managed to get in the sea, but still trapped in their plastic bags. "Now what?"
1/1	This and Trump in the same year. 2016 was a truly awesome year!
0/0	This angers me because they didn't think about Ireland and the fact that a huge European border is in the middle of Ireland and this will probably cause conflict but they aren't even mentioning it
1/1	This article sums up exactly how I feel. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR MINDS! Stand firm and let's just get out if they wont give us a fair deal. Have courage and be brave. Believe in this great country.
0/-1/-1	This being an international site there are plenty of people who are far enough removed from the situation too to see this and post and comment accordingly
1/1	This brought a Prideful tear to my eyes. FREEDOM is ALL.
1/1	This can go on forever. The eu bullies will not change their minds, they desperately don’t want us to leave and are doing all they can to prevent it. Just let us get out of this failing corrupt eu
0/0	This circus reminds me the last scene of ‘Finding Nemo’, when all the fish were happily free from Darla (EU) but trapped in the plastic bags with NO DAMN CLUE of what to do next
0	This comment is the text version of a small child holding a boot against their own head. You're going to be affected by the EU, but now you won't have any say in it. So push that boot harder, I guess.
1/1	This confirms that the EU has a death wish. Let's hope the end comes soon.
1/1	This country belongs to the crown,
0/0	This country has improved out of all recognition since joining. It's laughable to say you can't see any advantage.
0/0	This country is finished. Over.
0/0	This country is going down the drain while the tories squabble like a bunch of school kids.
1/1	This country is heading for great times, as soon as we cut off the leaches of Europe. Stop fearing my friend, look deeper about the EU, check out the killing rules of the Lisbon Treaty, we can’t even call ourselves a nation in 2020, that’s just the tip, it’s real - it’s true!
0/-1	This country was fine in my opinion before Brexit, so let's all settle down.
1/0	This deal is staged and will fail. Its all part of the grand plan to keep us in the EU. Just before the vote on this deal the EU says the UK can revoke article 50. Wow what a suprise. We wil not be leaving the EU that was the plan all along. Our vote is worth nothing.
0/0	This decision is a death blow to the poorest in the UK, unemployment will skyrocket now.
0/0/1	This decision makes me embarrassed to say I am British
0/0	This goof will only divide Britain more.
0/0	This government is about to do what no British government has ever done in history, to destroy Britain! Demand Ref2. Stop Brexit!
1/-1	This guy has a sense to make the Britain again
1/1	This guy who is out each day protesting for another vote to remain is renting a house a opposite Mogg at £6,000 a month...who is paying the rent.????
0/1	This has a horrific beauty to it. What has happened. Good god, what have we done.
0/0	This has angered me. Why have they been so probrexit for the last 4 years and now they are pointing out what a load of bollocks it is? If they'd have joined us in criticism and fact checks prior, then we'd still be a significant country.
0/0	This has been the biggest waste of time and money ever, the vote should never have taken place in the first place because it was based on a damaging lack of all the facts, we were all lied to.....everyone knows that a lot of leave voters are racist bigots who don't like johnnny foreigner coming over here and thats what we fought two world wars for blah blah blah, utter bullshit....then we have the argument that we don't want to get ruled by unelected people....so just like we get ruled by the banks and directors in charge who were not elected by the public, like your boss at work who was not elected by the public, like all of the police who were not elected by the people blah blah blah......we have an over inflated opinion of the UK and think we are so much better and powerful than we actually are and can easily stand on our own feet, really?? So where do we get most of our gas and electricity from?? where does over 80% of our supermarket food come from?? we produce hardly anything anymore except thousands of call centres and coffee shops.........
0/0	This has got to stop. #Stopbrexit. #PeoplesVote #OptionToRemain. I have never felt more ashamed of being British.
0/0	This has to STOP! In the event of #NoDeal, the surest thing to do is to withdraw #Article50. This must be a priority consideration for UK Parliament, who are bound to place our national security above all else.
0/0	This has to be one of the dumbest decisions ever made.. How will the UK economy ever work without eu?
0/0/0	This honestly makes me embarrassed to be British.
0/0	This i feel is going to bite them in the butt. No one in the Union is going to give them a helping hand i hope not. You need friendly helping neigbours. I now diffently Harry made the right move "get the hell out" $ of goods are going to sky rocket for bussiness owners. Alberta 🇨🇦 watch and learn!
0/0	This is Gibraltar who's people voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and are now forced to live under the yoke of the xenophobic little englander mobs rule.
0/0	This is The Telegraph making stuff up. It's terrified it's readers are waking up to the fact that Brexit isn't working. It can't work !
1/1	This is YOUR victory. For once, the little guy won.
0/1/0	This is a MAJOR blow to the one world Government of the New World Order! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/1	This is a biased and narrow view of us leaving the EU, why not report on the great foundation that us leaving will produce. I think you have got an incorrect name for your Channel, no way should you be reporting on 'Global' News!
1/1	This is a big day for people who feel like they personally fought in WW2 despite being born in 1958.
1/-1	This is a celebration about it finally being over
1/1	This is a choice of common sense, that it is not the intentions of Britain to be apart of an undemocratic Union.
1/1	This is a club that we are told it is wonderful to belong too. I don't think so.
0/0	This is a crazy joke! Fed up of Brexit what a mess!!! UK is a worldwide laughing emoji
0/-1	This is a deliberate and wilful act of self harm- there is nothing less patriotic than Brexit.
1/1	This is a glorious speech! I am so happy for the people of the United Kingdom! You're free again!
0/0	This is a good man, he knows what he's talking about. Take his advise, vote IN!
1	This is a good piece. I would go so far as to say that had the EU fanatics foiled brexit I would have supported an armed uprising and I am a Mr goody two shoes. Thankfully we have avoided that and the destruction of our democracy. God bless the UK the British people and dear old Nigel farage who's family were put through hell by the crazy remainders.
1/1	This is a great day, Britain is an independent sovereign state once again, come what may and it might get a little rough we are free from the shackles of the EU. Free to run our own country.
1/1	This is a great day. Hopefully Boris can do what Trump has done. No more pandering to these elite left traitors.
0/0	This is a messy divorce!
1/1	This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.
1/1/1	This is a momentus day. I have longed for this day for decades. I have been considered extreme or naïve or culpable of wishful thinking over the years as I foretold the UK exit from the EEC / EU one day and our rejection of the Euro. I am still considered all those things by some for anticipating the final collapse of the EU / USE one day. Mark my words, this is a great day for the Western world and the 21st century. This is the day when the 20th century is finally buried. The old certainties of European dominance, of bigger is better, of regulation over flexibility are gone. In the future nations will have to be fleeter of foot, educate their populations to adapt not adopt, be ready for the technology and natural changes that will shape our environment (both physically and culturally). The UK is back in business. The world is our oyster and the world is welcome to trade with us, engage with us, live with us and be our partners and friends. We welcome those who wish to have sanctuary here and who are willing to abide by our laws (and not import their own). We welcome those who wish to trade with us. We welcome those who wish to seek friendship and mutual assurance against those that would wish us ill. We will stand by our friends and guard against our enemies. We will help and assist those who find themselves in trouble, particularly those in the EU in the years to come as that crumbling edifice finally gives way. We will help as we did in the centuries gone by and we will gladly do so, for we know that to have a strong Europe is to have security for our islands. We do not wish to see an undemocratic, fractious and politically extreme Europe. God Save the Queen and long live the UK
1/-1	This is a perfect example of the failure of democracy in the information age. Voters ask for one thing, then the opponent runs a fear campaign and the voters have buyers remorse. If this is how you conduct business you'll never get anything done.
1/1	This is a perfect illustration of why BREXIT is so correct and necessary to begin with. Centralized, dictatorial, authoritarian, unaccountable, un-elected government from the outside.
1/1	This is a sad day for remainers but a good day for democracy
0/0	This is a sad day. It won’t look different tomorrow. It won’t even feel different. But like any death, GriefnLoss will cloud the eye and simultaneously harden and tear our hearts. Never forget this was put into place by nefarious immoral n self interested politicians
0/0	This is a terrible day.
0/0	This is a travesty for the average Brit. Watch what will happen. Prices will rise...jobs will get scarcer... it will be a disaster !
0/-1	This is a very unreasonable stance from the brits and it will only make Europe stronger. The EU must do what's best
0/0/0	This is a very very bad not good day for Britain
1/1	This is a video made as part of the remain campaign..
0/0	This is about immediacy, isn't it. People see immigrants in their town, but they only indirectly see the benefits. And the politicians and newspapers attribute blame - or credit - for their contribution.
1/1	This is about loving being a part of Europe but hating being a part of the European Union.
0/0	This is absolutely true, but after Brexit, anti-Corbynism and utter right wing bias on Question Time and the Today programmes it will be an uneasy alliance
0/0	This is actually sad
1/1	This is all done to force a second referendum.It's a massive deception. This is nothing new all political parties lie and cheat. No way will I be changing my OUT vote.
0/0	This is almost criminal levels of incompetence. There is no mandate for this. What the fuck are we doing to ourselves?
1/1	This is an absolute failure of democracy for the government failing to enforce the will of the people.
1/-1	This is an actual masterpiece, it brought a tear of joy to my eye.
0/0	This is an example of “don’t fix something that isn’t broken"
0/0	This is an example of “don’t fix something that isn’t broken”
1/1	This is an excellent summary and proves the Brexiteers correct. The EU are being unreasonable and arrogant. They are being stubborn and putting their politics ahead of reason and the nation's they purport to serve. If they want to play chicken then they will lose. We will drift towards no deal and they will be to blame.
0/1	This is as stark as it gets so voting Remain is the only option.No time to take risks.
0/0	This is awful! Why do they do this?
1/0	This is because the nationalists have portrayed the EU as an oppressive force - thereby fooling people into believing that #Brexit equates to "FREEDOM". When the truth is, by stripping us all of our rights & freedoms under EU law, we are being oppressed by the populists
0/0	This is becoming more amusing by the day. I can't believe an entire country fell for this nonsense.
0/0/0	This is disastrous!
0/0	This is embarrassingly crap! This will be shown all over the world as us leaving Europe, OMG
1/1	This is exactly what the EU dictators were afraid of. If England is successful with its Brexit, that could open the floodgates for others to follow. The EU is becoming an unwanted organization, that will soon dissolve in the dust bins of history...good riddance.
1/1	This is first piece on video that has tapped into the real anger about British membership of the EU . People feel they are second class citizens in their own land and they do not like being ignored whilst mass migration is imposed upon them. They voted leave because they want at least the semblance of democracy back. Under the EU there is no democracy. If Brexit is sabotaged as seems likely by Theresa May that anger will transfer to social unrest or worse. Leave means leave that it.
0/0	This is going to cost Britain SO many billions.
1/1	This is going to save the UK. Congratulations.
1/1	This is hilarious were leaving...accept it. Psychologically filling the gaps with negative connotation will not stop this great nation leaving the dictatorship.
0/0	This is home, our home and Earth. We will stay!
1/1	This is how democracy dies... with EU funded nobles overruling the people
0/0	This is just a horrible decision. Scotland didn’t even vote for this and I won’t be surprised if they voted to be free from the UK and join as a member of the EU.
1/1	This is just garbage, nothing in here makes me change my mind. The cold hard facts on the EUnion are there in black and white in the Constitution. Its antithetical to democratic principles. I still want nothing to do with them.
0/0	This is just like when GERI HALLIWELL overestimated her valiability as a soloartist and left the Spice Girls
0/1	This is just the money that would go to british farmers anyways.
1/1	This is just the start of the end of the EU. When other nations find out how well we have done in the future without the EU, they will leave too.
0/1	This is just what the EU wants. Every one fighting. Don't let it happen. A solution can and will be found as in other countries. There is no way Ireland is going to leave the EU as, in all fairness, the money they receive from the EU is handsome so whyshould they leave. They are far better off now than they have ever been and fair play. To start swearing and name calling is just what Brussels want. Don't give it to them. We have all got along great for many years now and will continue to do so with the will of all of us.
0/0	This is like when Geri Halliwell overestimated her viability as a solo artist and left the spice girls.
0/1	This is nonsense, they are make something out of nothing. Just because their New World Order is falling apart, they are trying to cause panic.
1/0/1	This is not an end, but a beginning.
0/0	This is not just about politics. This will affect the lives of many people. Brits that have worked in the European Union will now be considered a foreigner. No more traveling across the borders and much more. Trade. Companies that have built a business somewhere in Europe. So much that will need to be changed. I do not think when the people voted they were fully informed of the complexity!!
0/0	This is not the end. it is the beginning of the end.
1/0	This is not what we voted for! Back-stabbing, secret treachery. The Government should resign.
0/1	This is now becoming an embarrassment, or rather SHE is becoming an embarrassment. The whole lot of them not just Mrs Maybot, should resign. She is so arrogant that she is prepared to plunge this country into darkness and for what ??
0/0	This is one of the things I find frustrating about the arguments for #Brexit. The #EU is so much more than just trade. It's social & cultural cooperation for peace & prosperity. I used to work on EU funded research. We're throwing it all away for no benefit. Brexit is pointless.
1/1	This is our country, this is our people. We aren't gonna fall because we've got eachother. Be proud of our flag be proud of our name, we are the UK and we're going to shine once again
0/-1	This is playing games by the British politicians, also explores the disadvantage of Democracy
0/0/0/0	This is probably an insensitive thing to say but sadly its true ... most of the ppl that voted "Leave" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision...instead of caring for their young older Brits chose to hate immigrants so much they screwed their younger generation out of mobility and jobs and and an open market .... Bravo!
0/0	This is ridiculous everything that happens in this bloody country country they blame the emigrants lol wtf the main problem is the Eastern European’s is sad really the black girl she said we take their job well they lazy to work lol
0/0	This is ridiculous. Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well. They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
0/-1	This is seriously biased.
1/-1	This is so dumb. Yes, they covered all the cons of Brexit, but the pros are way too much. Liberty above all, baby.
1/1	This is so exciting! YAY, and congratulation Brits!
0/0/0	This is so funny worldwide everyone is laughing at England about this
0/0	This is such a joke, Brexiteers scream about sovereignty and being ruled from Brussels. Yet they are quite willing to take us out of a Brussels based supranational organisation where we are one of the most powerful voices and benefit enormously, only to immediately subjugate us to the power & control of a Geneva based supranational organisation where we barely have a voice at all and will be forced to obey rules, regulations & conditions that make it much harder for our companies who will also face new tariffs & trade barriers.
1/1	This is the Best thing that they ever did.. Britain has been dragged through the mud with all the integration of uneducated migrants and the Muslim invasion.
1/1	This is the EU begging for a NO DEAL.
1/0	This is the SINGLE most articulated view on watering down the Brexiteers I have had the pleasure to watch.
0/0/0/0	This is the UK decay
0/1	This is the beginning of the end for the UK union.
0/1	This is the beginning of the end of the EU
0/0/0	This is the beginning of the end. Feels so sad.
0/1	This is the biggest one sided hit piece I've ever seen, I expect better.  The EU is an undemocratic bureaucracy.  They wanted an EU army, and to make Britain start using the Euro.  Countries shouldn't be completely united as it enforce the opinions of the majority of a continent on a huge minority which could all reside in certain countries. Overall, you guys are being dishonest to not tell people tye whole story!
0/1	This is the day when The UK has started the process of being ruled by Europe rather than deciding together with the rest of Europe
1/1	This is the effect of " * illegal Muslim immigration * " in the region without thinking on order of brainlessAngela Merkel . Believe or not BRITAIN done its job..And I must appreciate decision of people of Britain.
1/1	This is the end of Political Correctness in the UK. We want a second referendum to really shove it the face of Remoaners!
0/0	This is the end of the United Kingdom.
0/1/0	This is the end of the United Kingdom. Scotland and perhaps Wales will go their own way, and Ireland will finally be united. Cameron, May, and Johnson will have brought on what Napoleon and Hitler never could accomplish. At least you will still be able to get to Ireland from France, without passing through England. How long will it be before the little England folks flood the channel tunnel?
0/0	This is the end. I'm moving.
1/1	This is the greatest moment in modern British history.

1/-1	This is the kind of self-destructive rejection of reality that will lead to Europe's destruction at the hands of foreign invaders.
0/0	This is the level of how smart some of the leave voters are.
0/0	This is the moment for us to change - to fight for continued membership and then playing a more ACTIVE ROLE in shaping the future of the EU.

0	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority
0/0	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority. You cannot drag 48% of a nation out of a union they wish to be a part of whilst at the same time promising to heal division. A dark day indeed.
1/-1	This is the perfect opportunity for young people be take on apprenticeship with these companies! Now let’s see all those people walking around saying they took our jobs get jobs, I’ll back it in they don’t.
0/0/0	This is the problem of swinging the pendulum to the other extreme as a knee jerk reaction. Yes, Britain and Europe in general faced a huge immigration crisis in 2014-15. However the answer is not the other extreme where you take in 0 immigrants. Like anything else in real life, you need to find the right balance and moderate.
1/1	This is the whole point of “funding” from the EU! Where did they get the money from in the first place? Would you deposit £1000 in your bank to receive back £800 and then say “ Oh thank you how wonderful you are” ? Not bloody likely is the answer, but this is exactly what we have done for 47 years! Incredible isn’t it?
1/1	This is the will of the people, a great victory for direct democracy!
1/1	This is the work of globalists. We must name them so that we can fight them.
0/0	This is the worst trade negotiation since Star Wars: the phantom menace
0/0	This is total lunacy. They just shot themselves on the foot. They will regret it.
1/1	This is unbelievable. Controlling shareholders in public companies? What ARE they on? Suppose we then said that we want all our leccy companies to be owned by Britaish shareholders? And forced them to be so acquired? At rock bottom cost? This is so silly it must mark the end of the EU as a serious organisation
0/0	This is utter madness! Why don't they stop it? Not ONE good thing is going to come out of Brexit! And please don't .mention 'sovereignty', we always had it!
1	This is vitally important, knowing first hand the importance free movement had on my professional music career.
0/0	This is what Brexit has done. It’s brought the racist twats out into the open. This poster was put up in a block of flats in Norwich. The dregs of society are emboldened by what was always a project by the right made popular by anti immigrant lies & propaganda from Blojo’s pals!
0/1	This is what Brexit was all about. 51st state, here we come.
0/0	This is what I don’t get about leavers... they make out that we give the EU money but don’t get the same amount back... have they never heard of a membership before? You don’t walk into the gym and pay for your membership and then expect them to pay you back do you? No. You pay for use of the services they provide and that’s how a membership works...
1/1	This is what I said to my friend just after the vote. UK voted to exit the EU but we'll soon see that this vote does not count and UK will stay in EU anyway. It is the end of democracy so the beginning dictatorship.
1/1	This is what I've been saying for weeks that the eu are taking the piss out of United Kingdom so why doesn't the queen get involved
0/-1	This is what Uncertainty does for decision making. A shame and tip of ice berg I think.
0/0	This is what full employment looks like???, minimum wage jobs and zero hour contracts!!!...Yet these people blame the EU???, this is squarely down to the intransigent tory government...
0/0	This is what happens when you act without planning You will regret and back-paddle
0/0	This is what nationalist populism does to a country.
1/1	This is what people need to know. Out means out 221747 it’s a Petition for out!
1/1	This is what the EU were afraid of, can you imagine what the produces of 27 countries are going to say to those unelected beaurocrats in Brussels, yep, just as we thought," we still need to trade with the UK our livelihoods depend on it " when will they ever learn ?
1/1	This is what the eu does... f... all...
0/0/0	This is what they do in banana republics. It seems we are heading in that direction!
0/0	This is where the delusions of Brexiters meets reality. The EU should just call Johnson's bluff.
1/1	This is why I hated the remain campaign. They made liberal idiots hijack the idea EU and Europe are the same thing. The EU is a toxic cloud, every major European country has movements to leave. It is zero to do with being anti European.
0/0	This is why I say exit brexit, get a real plan and I truly believe that the swing vote will go your way!

0/0	This isn't a fight. It's just self-harm. What do we get if we "win"? I just don't see the benefit to all this.
0	This isn't even close to a revolution! A revolution isn't lead by right wing elitists such as farage and boris
1/1	This isn't what I voted for. Revolution please.
0/0	This isn’t a celebration about leaving it’s a celebration of it finally being over.... now we can get screwed over
1	This just means the stage is being set for the fulfilment of prophecy. Britain a protestant nation had to remove itself from the EU pack of catholic nations. The nations which will help usher in the Anti-christ are all catholic.... part of the original 10 nations which is a part of the Roman empire.
1/1	This just shows how useless and pointless the parliament actually is, if as you say it is a forgone conclusion done deal by behind the scenes commities. The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy. Its why we are leaving.
1/1	This kind of reporting instigates trouble no matter what camp you are in.If remain had won we wouldn’t be having this conversation because the result would have been accepted.Why on earth remainers cannot accept a democratic vote doesn’t say much for our democracy
1/1	This makes a no-deal/WTO Brexit even more likely. Bye bye EU 👋👋
0/0/0	This makes me feel so bad for my kids. In a few years they’ll be in the job market, so many opportunities have been take away from them - they only have British passports. We’ve become 2nd class citizens in Europe
1/1	This man is right. we voted OUT, if they don't want a Deal, they do not get the money!
1/0	This man is so stupid as to not understand why older people voted brexit. If England is better off as a part of the EU, they would have voted to stay. They are the ones who remember. TED is a leftist nation propaganda machine, nothing more.
0/0	This may come as a complete surprise to many #Brexit supporters, but the EU trade negotiator Michel Barnier will be looking after the interests of the 27 countries that are members of the EU. Strangely, there is no requirement for him to look after the interests of a non-member!
0/0/0	This may come as a surprise to many Brexiteers but you were always going to have a worse off deal than the one you have with the EU now.
0/1	This means nothing. The EU have no reason to give us an extension. We should have left at the original date
1/0	This more than anything. We need the EU because our governments are often irresponsible
0/0	This morning as I reached for my inhaler I'm very thankful I don't live in the UK. I'd be worried sick I'd not be able to get the right medication. Not being able to breathe can really affect your overall quality of life* #Brexit #RevokeA50
0/0/0	This not going to end well...
1/1	This open border does not allow us to check and control people
1/1	This place we call home was not, and never will be a REGION OF EUROPE--it is a place called THE BRITISH ISLE
1/-1	This propaganda against nation states is based on a fallacy. It was not nationalism that caused the war; it was fascism.
0/0	This reflects the total failure of the UK to correctly prioritize education and training.
0/0	This reminds me of a caged animal, afraid to come out when the door is opened
1/-1	This reminds me of a caged animal, afraid to come out when the door is opened. Then peopld, who want to be smart and in control, saying you won't be safe.
1/1	This remoaner bilge is tiresome. It is a lie that there is a silent majority for remain, it is simply not true that those who didn't vote want to stay in the EU. We had a national vote, the turnout was excellent and the result conclusive. Non voters chose not to take part, we know nothing about their views. If remoaners insist on counting them it simply shrinks their share from 48% to 34%.
0/0	This result doesn't change any of the facts: • Brexit is still a terrible idea • Johnson is still a liar • The EU still won't let us have our cake and eat it • The US will still drink our milkshake • Vote Leave still cheated and the Tories used similar tactics this time • The Tories will still primarily serve their rich donors
1	This should have been done three years ago ,now we would be well down road an away from the EU dictatorship by now
0/0	This so called UK Government should be dismissed for gross incompetence and misconduct...what an unbelievable State we have become!
0/0	This sort of unreasonable thinking and angry behaviour makes me worried about the future. Trying to blame all problems on migrants when they have contributed so much to the U.K makes me feel sick.
1/1	This time tomorrow our Great country will be on a new future that we control, govern and direct. There's been generations of people whilst under EU rule, who have not known or experienced how great the United Kingdom was and what we have to offer the World and what a fantastic position we are viewed from by other countries around the World, countries that are lining up to be part of our future. Yes we will have re-moaners saying next week why hasn't the Government changed anything and lets go back, but that's just part of this instant change culture that expect everything to be done at a click of a button. Things take time, great changes takes time. Happy Brexit Day :-)
1/1	This video does not tell the full story. Immigration is a secondary factor to leave the EU. The primary one is making sure Britain remains a fee and independent country and does not become a province of a United Sates of Europe. This is the main reason we will be going and not return.
0/0	This video is completely ridiculous. The Eu has more benefits and we should definitely stay
1/1	This video proves how moronic remainers are. We need to leave the evil EU!!
0/0	This vote FOR Brexit was TrumpTarded. Idiots for rialed up by stupid false racist propaganda and voted for a terrible decision w clear thinking people staying at home & not voting. They should have the core again. If Brexit wins carry on. If it gets overturned then drop it.
0/0	This was a sad day
0/0/0	This was a terrible decision and I think it would never pass if voted on again.
0/0	This was always going to happen and was seen by all remainders. Only the blue passport gang would deny this was always on the cards.
1/-1	This was interesting but slightly naive. The EU exports far more to us than we export to them. If they don't do a deal and 10% tariffs go up in both directions they lose out. That's why they've said they don't want "unfair competition" from us, because they can't handle competition. The UK economy is as big as 18 EU countries combined.
0/0	This was never going to work out. The people promoting Brexit all left after they won and left the pro EU people deal with the outcome. This referendum was dumb to start with. The EU has its issues, but breaking it up won’t fix it.
0/0	This was not a political revolution. the leavers got absolutely nothing. they've admitted that this will not stop immigration, they've admitted that this will not save the NHS, they've given Boris Johnson the Prime Minister title - he's more right wing than Camron and will cut a lot more then him, they've divided divided the UK more then ever, Scotland is sure to leave. Oh and obviously the housing market will crash again.
0/0	This was not democracy. The Brexit leaders are admitting they misled ppl Many ppl used vote as protest against Gvmt
1/1	This was one of the proudest moments of my life. Britain woke up in time.
1/1	This was the best birthday ever. for 9 years i had been shouting at the tv asking where was my referendum whenever the was governent on tv.
1/1	This what we been saying all the time. We will be better of outside the EU. A lot of the other big Countries will not be.
1/1	This whole Brexit charade tells us a couple of things... The EU is worse than we thought and wants to punish us for voting leave.
0/0	This whole Brexit shambles has brought embarrassment and humiliation upon us Brits. I am deeply ashamed of my country, but immensely proud of being a Citizen of Europe (at least for the remaining 6 hours). But I'm sure we WILL be back!
0/0	This whole Brexit was a conservative policy, so lets get another party in office who doesn't believe in it and save our economy. We can fix most Brexitiers problems. Enforce the WTD which will lead to lower cost homes, less Europeans coming as they won't be able to work anymore hours than other EU countries. Zero hour contracts will end as employers tie staff in, people will have social time so pubs and other social activities will grow including family time and so on. Yes, we will still pay £8b a year, but if the Banks and the car industry take £1 Trillion over to Berlin/EU as planned, it will take 125 years offset just that and not 50 years like Mogg says, just consider the tax and reinvestment of our money being moved across will stay in the EU.
0/0	This whole brexit fiasco is already in chaos
0/0	This whole brexit thing is like watching someone who decided to shoot themselves in the foot for no good reason endlessly debate whether they should seek medical attention or just keep on shooting and see if things get better.
0/-1	This whole fucking mess is due to the tories putting party before country for the past 5 years.
0/0	This whole referendum is a smoke screen. People should unite and live in peace. Nationalism through history caused only destruction. Vote stay and lets make the EU strong and prosperous!
1/1	This will be SKI News with more Scaremongering or reporting on something that could go wrong if we leave this Corrupt EU..Don't listen to the scaremongering it's been happening for many years. Brexit will make the UK stronger..
0/0	This will be a mess.
0/0	This will be a significant road-marker on the historical decline of GB
1/1	This will be the perfect year if Donald Trump gets elected, Hillary Clinton gets arrested, the European Union dissolves, and Scotland gets independence.
0/0	This will be viewed as a huge victory. That each household has saved €7 to travel, when brexit is still going to cost each household thousands each year! 🤦♀️🤦♀️🤦♀️🤦♀️🤦♀️🤦♀️
0/0/0	This will cause instability in the UK and EU
0/1	This will end in tears, and it was so foreseeable.
0/1	This will harm all countries and citizens involved for years to come.
0/0	This will slowly lead to the collapse of the uk
0/-1	This woman is horrendous - sums up the UK media perfectly! >:(
1/1	This year we had net immigration which equated to a city the size of Newcastle, next year it could be a city the size of Manchester and there is not a thing we can do about it so long as we are in the EU. No wonder the people using A&E increased by 14% in just one year and next year immigration will be even greater following the increase in the living wage which is a massive draw for those in Eastern and Southern Europe. Our hospitals cannot cope, our schools cannot cope, we do not have enough houses and eventually there will be not enough jobs. We must stop this madness and get out now and at least we can then decide who comes into our country and the numbers. At the moment we can do precisely nothing, whatever Cameron and Corbyn tell us.
1/0	This “weaker, poorer” EU institution is one that Britain is desperate to have a trade deal with.
0/0	This. There are towns in the UK that are so poor they have had millions poured into them by EU development grants and Farmers who depend on EU subsidy to survive. Still they lobbied and voted BREXIT. Fucking idiots.
0/0	Those that voted for it deserve to suffer for their ignorance and posturing.
1/1	Those unelected overlords in Brussels are not happy you fine Brits took your country back and will try to punish you as a example. Stay strong my cousins across the pond, we back you all the way !
0/0	Those who argue for Brexit are wrong, and that is because they have not been properly informed about the costs.
1/1	Those who chose not to vote, have no right to complain about the consequences of their inaction
1/1	Those who don't want us to leave are the immigrants who have not taken out British Citizenship such as, Romanians, Bulgarians, Polish & Muslims because they don't want to lay the costs of becoming a British Citizen!
0/0	Those who look forward to Trump's second term, are the same type of individual excited about Brexit. I believe Putin destroyed two once great and respected nations weaponizing social media propaganda. It was highly effective.
0/0	Those who saw the vote as a protest against poverty are now experiencing the thin end of the wedge of inflation from a falling pound
1/1	Those who say No Deal is bad say it because they want the UK to give away it's best negotiation tool. Why? - because they want to reverse the democratic vote and to remain in the EU
0/0	Those who voted for leave will cry the most in the future.
1/0	Those who were concerned about the effects of uncontrolled immigration on jobs, wages, housing, public services and the welfare of their children were smeared as 'racists'
1/0/1	Those willing to give up freedom for security deserve neither.
1/0	Though I'm very Leave, I agree with a one off 10% wealth tax on the richest companies and people (say assets more than half a million)In England to help the poorer nations of Europe adjust. International solidarity. Only a certain type of person could possibly object.
1/0	Though no deal brexit would be the worst thing to happen
1/1	Threaten the EU to make UK a tax Haven, you would soon get Company's moving over to the UK. Not my idea of business but to hell with the EU.
0/0	Through commonly agreed EU standards, national Governments have achieved improvements to the quality of air, rivers and beaches. Good for Britain and good for Britons holidaying or living abroad!
1/1	Throughout all Europe, we are more than proud of the Brits for having escaped the European tyranny. Let's hope numerous nations will follow you up!
0/-1	Thundering, thankyou, and needed today. It's sinking in, the vile culture already emanating from the new headmistress at number 10 and her cabal of disgraced or lying or incompetent or nasty appointees. What a sermon, what a finger wagging croak from the unelected head of government. As for the disgusting corbyn and his followers, no better. Shrieking about democracy while ignoring the voters at large in the country. And I am hoping the signs of some fightback will grow: against the bully boys of ukip and the anarchists of the left and the self enriching crowd of bankers' friends who believe they can ride their coach and horses back to an authoritarian past. It's getting so reason and balance is being choked out by these people who have been getting away with it for a few years now.

1/1	Time for Remoaners to finally admit they never really liked the EU either, in fact they barely know a thing about it, they just hate Britain (taking their lead from the BBC).
0/1	Time for a people’s vote to break the further deadlock so we can attempt to drag ourselves out of this mess with a little damage as possible.
0/0	Time for some democracy. Let the people vote on the deal or to remain. Why are the Brexiters so afraid of another vote? Because they know that, having seen the facts, the people will not vote to be poorer. They will vote to remain. We are staying in the EU.
1/1	Time for the European union to be history! once and for all! Europeans! Take your country's back NOW!!

1/1	Time to regain our courage to make Great Britain great again
0/0	Time to respect the will of the people......and stay in the EU.
0/0	Time to save remain. We must not allow remain to be thwarted. Brexit is a lunatic idea with catastrophic consequences and must be prevented.
1/1	Time to start stamping passports and reducing immigration, not to invoke article 50 to negotiate with people who have already said they will not negotiate. Better to negotiate from inside than outside. With regards to the forthcoming down votes, perhaps they should leave and go and live in the EU if they love it so much.
1/1	Time to take our country back Let's go Red card to the eu Let's take our country back! auf veedetsen Angela Bye yo Borat We want our country back

1/0	Time will tell if Brexit is a disaster or success. The UK has jumped off the cliff, now we will get to see how fast they can flap their arms to fly.
0/0	Time will tell what the advantages of Brexit (if any) are. All of the rhetoric by Farage and his Brexit Party misfits, will soon be shown to be a pack of lies. Never mind, the English proletariat don't care, now they have their freedumb.
1/1	Time will tell, but if you do the research, you'll see that leaving was the best for Britain! Good job! Glad to see you regain your Independence and democracy - "we the people" have spoken!!

0/1	Tired of hearing re #Brexit that ‘The Great British Public will pull through’ ‘We are a resilient nation and have been in tougher spots’ etc.. All true, of course we will eventually. But why the hell are we putting ourselves through this? This isn’t what was promised!

0/-1	To all of the people here supporting a on deal Brexit - do you have any idea of the kind of havoc it would wreak? If so, can you please explain to me what kind of reward you expect from Brexit that would make bearing the chaos that comes after a no deal leave of the EU OK?
1/1	To all the Project Fear scaremongers running around spreading fear of Britain starving the morning after Brexit. India's got Britain's back. Punjab - the world's most fertile land of the five rivers, granary of the world, breadbasket of a billion people. Bring on Brexit!
0/0	To all the Remainers, I’m sorry too loose you from our big family, You are always welcome. To all the Brexiters. You are resented and pretty much hated by everyone in the 27 member states. You talk about Independence Day, and Freedom like you have fought off a occupying force. You have insulted every single country inside the EU, I own a Business that have suppliers and Customers all over the EU. If any of my suppliers or customers have acted like most Brexiters. I will cancel everything with that customer or Supplier. And Yes if you are wondering it is remarkable easy to tracking people’s online activity! Brexiters, Stay on your Island! You are seriously not welcome!
0/0	To all the leavers, did you honestly think you could trust the brexiteers? Just look at them, most of them are abject cunts who think the poor should be killed off. IDS, Rees-Mogg, Farage. When was the last time you heard a leading brexiteer talk about poor people in anything other than disparaging language?
0/-1	To all the remainers, you have my most heartfelt sympathies.
1/1	To all the uniformed people making accusations that Britain cannot make up its mind what it wants, they did decide something clearly. It was the EU who roundly rejected it cos they are playing hardball. They voted with a majority for the Brady amendment which means the withdrawal agreement but with a unilateral exit mechanism four the backstop. A reasonable caveat in a post colonial world. EU said no as they have done for two years. What you are seeing now is not the UK being unable to make up it's mind what it wants. It is the UK being unable to accept the vassalage from the EU. History will judge this moment very differently to how most of you nitwits are reading it.
0/0	To all those Brexiters telling people to "get over it" and "you lost" when commenting on any post that refers negatively on Brexit... do you not see how these comments reflect so badly on yourself and see why the Remainers have such a problem with those that voted to leave the EU? The only logical reason I can see for you posting the way you are, is that you don't give two flying f**ks about the country you live in anyway, because in case you didn't notice, a struggling economy benefits very few and the poorest are always hit the hardest... so I have to conclude that your patriotic views can only be posturing, as flushing the country down the toilet is obviously anything but patriotic.
0/0	To any friends from the EU reading this - I can assure you that a huge percentage of the UK population are sorry to leave the EU and don’t believe it is the best move for us. We are also embarrassed about those MEP muppets waving flags and behaving like children. Some of us hope to leave this God forsaken country as soon as possible and are working on that too ❤️

1/0	To be clear, you can't be #probrexit and not #ProBreakUp, the arguments are almost identical.
1/1	To be clear, you can't be #probrexit and not #ProBreakUp, the arguments are almost identical. It's time for Wangland to get a new flag.
0/0	To be fair, the problems with Brexit do not really stem from the decision itself. It's the fact that it was so unexpected, so when you add incompetency and conflicting interests all of a sudden, it ends up like this. If it was a decision supported by an actual majority of population and politicians and was planned ahead, it would look different.
1/-1/-1	To be fair, the soft brexit option was never really there so I guess it was always going to be a hard
0/0	To be honest I am looking forward to the bumbling #JohnsonTheLiar to have his interview with the attack dog #AndrewNeil. He shouldn't be on the @bbc he is very #rightwing very #probrexit not even slightly balanced Barclay Brother poodle #warmonger #climatechangedenier
1/1/-1	To be honest we weren't the little guy, we were the biggest MAJORITY, it was just the minority that kicked, screamed and cried at everything the MAJORITY did! It's like the old saying goes, "shy bairns get nowt” they got what they deserved!
0/0	To be honest, I believe Charles de Gaulle was right, UK doesn’t belong to the continent! But now it would be disastrous to leave EU. For both sides. And let’s not forget, that if UK leaves EU, that would give to Scotland the chance to split out and abandon England and UK would be dismantled.
0/0	To be honest, as much as I hate Brexit, it’s some pretty serious QC issues with the bikes and financial mismanagement (to put it generously) that have seen #Norton go under.
1/1	To be honest... EU is worst that can happen to the world... massive left totalitarism. Yes to Brexit!
0/0	To believe that Brexit will help solve some 'old' problems sounds incredibly naive. Brexit won't bring back industry, it won't lead to high pay, it won't solve the housing issues, it won't lead to investment in infrastructure or the NHS. If these things don't happen when you have a stable economy they are highly unlikely to happen with an unstable one.
0/0	To call the EU a communist state proves you don't know what communism is. It's closer to an USA then it is to the USSR
1/1	To claim that Brexit is the fault of "misinformed right wing" politicians is twoddle. Plenty of the left in Britain wanted out and not because they were misinformed but because they were fed up of the twisted democracy in which the EU operates. It was the right decision and this video truly comes across as propaganda for the centrists and the left making the right out to be manipulative villains of the people.
0/0/1/0	To fellow Americans watching this video, things can be best summed up like this: People in favor of Brexit are Trump supporters.
0/0	To hell with brexit.
1/1	To hell with the EU and those who run it.
0/0	To leave is a leap in the dark, all the Outers have is some vague promises that somehow it will be alright and everything will be hunky dory. The truth is that they haven't got a clue and their vanity is putting my, my family's and my country's financial and real security at risk.
0/0	To leave the EU at this time in history would be a pathetic paranoid whimpering protest at thin air causing irreparable damage #voteremain

1/1	To me I am happy the UK are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
1	To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
1	To remain in the dreadful elitist experiment called the EU is a race to the bottom for all honest hard working taxpayers as the elite will flood the nations with mi grants which in turn will break down our individual fantastic diverse countries and turn Europe into a mass melting pot which will then make the masses easier to control. And the rich will get richer. It stops now.
1/1	To summarize, we get control back of our own country. We get to decide immigration, not Brussels. So potentially we can almost completely stop immigration, or use Australia's points based system. Get rid of tons of pointless laws on various products, which big business loved, but which tends to kill off smaller innovative startups. Decisions won't be made by non-democratically elected bureaucrats in Brussels. Not sending countless millions to the EU every week. A chain reaction. If other countries also have an EU referendum, they also may get to leave too. The EU may die as a result.
1/1	To the EU, tick tock ! Well done Boris on a great speech.
0/-1	To the caretaker: Thanks mate for doing a great job keeping the City tidy! We really appreciate it! (Sincerely)
1/1	To the people crowing about how horrible this is that the UK is leaving the EU, I wonder where they were when the EU was taking the UK's money but giving them nothing in return.
0/1	To those people who have been swayed by the murder of Jo Cox I say this--The things that originally made you consider voting Leave are still there-The mass of migrants is still hammering at the door-The Eu is still intent on controlling every aspect of your life and will up it's demands if you vote remain.
1/1	To those resentful of the result: Please Google European army. Please try and imagine where that could lead a few years from now with the wrong president(s) in Brussels. Please also bare in mind that you have no vote at all over who is president in Europe.
0/-1/-1	To train people you need to have people who want to be trained. That means years of gaining qualifications and skills and having someone who will support you during that time. Whatever training you offer it will not change people's attitude to work who think everything was easy for others and everything should be easy.
0/0	Today Brexit... and tomorrow everyone will still be shopping in Lidl & Aldi.
0/0	Today I have my identity as an #EUCitizen stolen by a bunch of rich, right-wing shysters and gullible idiots.
0	Today I see many of the things I believe in (solidarity, cooperation, internationalism) abandoned to follow the empty rhetoric of the past (national interest, sovereignty). My optimism tells me that we must fight and we can revert #Brexit in the future but today is a day of grief
1/-1	Today I walked past a house that had an EU poster in the window. I smiled, that is all. Yet the homeowner opened his door and hurled abuse at me! These people are flipping bonkers.
0/-1	Today I went to see a doctor. It was FREE. If we have a no deal #BREXIT, the NHS will die, and you’ll have to pay to see a doctor. End it today. Call your MP
0/0	Today I’m disappointed and sad. I’m scared for my generation’s future and generations to come. Scientists receive so little funding from the UK we are very dependent on EU sources and collaboration. I won’t be surprised if over the coming years the UK’s output of original research falls because people, both European and British, choose to move and work elsewhere. I will likely be one of these people when I finish my PhD, I can’t imagine staying here where my work is not valued and every day is a fight to stay funded. I’m also sad that people have managed to be persuaded by the at times less than savoury leave campaign. ‘X’ amount of money won’t be diverted back in to the NHS. We’ve seen enough money-based promises that the government fails to go through with to know that. It is going to be very costly to maintain a decent position within finance and trade with the rest of the world. Also, immigrants are just as responsible for this country’s successe. They have given so much and continue to do so. Mainly, as citizens of the world, how can we turn away from people who are just looking for a better life and block ourselves off from the outside world?
0/0	Today a young person hoping to go to University may chose to study at any University within The European Union. The cost of studying here is £9000 a year. The cost of studying in Holland, for example ( where lectures are given in English ) is £1200 a year. Total cost for a 3 year course in Holland : £3 600. Total cost for a 3 year course in The UK : £27 000. Tell me that hundreds of thousands of young voters, your children, will be better off if we leave The European Union.
1/1	Today is a day to put all the battles behind us. All the divisions behind us. For everyone to come together. Let us celebrate and make the best of our future as Great Britain

0/0	Today is a real tragedy for the nation. I so sincerely hope they suffer as much as the rest of the less affluent population is going to suffer in the fallout after they have manipulated them for their own political ambition. Alas, I fear they won't give a damn because they have so much money in the bank they would not know what hardship feels like. You are too polite in calling them despicable :-).
0/0/0	Today is a sad day. Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood. We should be reaching out to our European friends rather than walking away from them. It is better to be internationalist rather than isolationist.
0/0	Today is a sad day. The UK has been a bit of a second home for me for years now. I lived in Edinburgh when the referendum happened. I've come to London to see theatre and to make theatre again and again while the Brexit date was pushed back again and again. Today feels unreal.
0/0	Today is polling day. Vote for hope over fear, and because we need to build bridges, not burn them. #VoteRemain.

0/0	Today marks the start of a new error in Britain’s history
0/0	Today some British bank announced it was moving 190BLN of assets out of the UK to Ireland, because of Brexit.
0/0	Today we leave the EU - one of the world's biggest and most successful single markets. We start losing the freedom to live, study or work in Europe. We exit rules which cleaned our beaches, made our living standards better, stopped us working long hours, defined better rest periods and delivered over 50 years of peace, stability and prosperity. The media told us about "mad EU rules" that, in reality, our British MEP's voted on and accepted. They told us about blue passports which we could've had all along. They told us about the "uncontrolled migration" which, in reality, was allowed because our own government didn't apply EU migration rules properly. In charge, Boris Johnson - the man who lost a quarter of a million buying a water cannon. The gate is open and the horse has bolted. Good luck everyone.
1/1/1	Today we throw off the shackles of tyranny and claim our country back.
0/0	Today's Financial Times front page "Javid set to miss surplus target as finances head for £12bn black hole". More austerity or tax rises, or both? #r4today I reckon this #Brexit thing was not a wise idea.

0/0	Today, 100% of the population has been fucked over by 26% of the population at the behest of 1% of the population. Fuck Brexit.
0/0/0	Today, I am disgusted to be British ... I resent what I thought was a minority in this country, ignorant people, but it seems fear tactics from the likes of Farage and Johnson have convinced people to ruin a future that doesn’t belong to them. As a teenager living in London, my future, and my friends’ future, has been taken away from us and tossed into disarray by people who are completely alien from the things they are scared of. Immigration was never the problem, money was never going to go into the NHS, and we’re less “free” than we ever were with the financial and political crash that is happening. And all we can do as the progressive and inclusive youth of Britain is watch our elders destroy what little we had to build on. Seeing idiots like Farage call for “independence day” as the pound plummets makes me think that we were in a better place before we let bigots decide our future. I don’t know what to do, I sit here in awe of the place I am no longer proud to live in, surrounded by people I am no longer proud to be associated with. Fear has changed this country forever. I hope whoever voted leave is happy with the turmoil they’ve sent us into.

0/0	Totally depressing result, a sad day for Britain, the EU and future generations.....
1/1	Tough luck Remainers, you have held this country back for almost four years now with your petty antics and blockades. It's our time to shine now and gain our rightful place on the world's economic and political stage. The sleep lion is about to roar.
1/0	Towns and small cities across the UK are deprived of industry, jobs, and evolution onto the modern stage.
0/1	Trade deal? Lol! Nothing will L be done. There will be nothing granted by the EU. WTO it will be.
1/1	Trade is precisely about sovereignty. Follow my rules, and you can sell into my market. Don't and you can't. Only a fool would then decide to follow rules set by others, have disputes resolved by someone else's court or agree to any deal that comes with such constraints attached. May was such a fool, Boris isn't.
0/0	Trade is vitally important, but also has Johnson got anything to say about social issues? Is it a UK objective to retain reciprocal healthcare arrangements for UK citizens who move to the EU after the transition period? Is it the UK’s intention to continue uprating with inflation the pensions of those citizens?
0/1	Trading on WTO rules, is not frictionless trade.

0/0	True - it is not about "believing the EU above the UK" it iabout beliving in the UK as part of the EU. No different from Yorkshore as part of England or Wales as part of the UK. If you feel different you have no right to argue at all about further power to the devolved assemblies or their total independance from the UK
0/0	True stories: Leaver told me that he voted Brexit because he wanted his South African x-wife out of the country. Another one because she hated her Egyptian x-husband. ... and an EU national voted leave because her husband is Caribbean .. when I said what that means she said loudly "I told you my husband is Caribbean !!" .. go figure. Bottom line NONE of the above mentioned people have any clue or idea of what they voted for.
0/0	True to the best, wise from our worst, for the UK there is no retreating from the EU, the world, the future.
0/0	True. As a Californian I can say, with certainty: The only thing worse than an uninformed legislator making law is an uninformed citizen making law. Majority rule becomes mob rule (it's also how our legislature often ducks responsibility)
1/1	True. The European Union is like a giant toilet pull where Muslims come to take super liquidy diareah shits. And you fuckers are stuck in this giant toilet bowl until you find a way out.
0/0	Truly extraordinary - 34.9% believe it would be "good for Britain' to leave the EU with no alternative arrangements in place. That the Vote Leave campaign has been able to persuade such a significant portion of the electorate that having substantially all our very extensive cooperation agreements with our nearest neighbours, close allies and largest trading partners simply fall away would be positive is simply baffling. So self-evidently ridiculous.

0/0	Try being Irish and watching what's going on. England is now fondly referred to here as our "old enemy" but our bond and cultural similarities have never been stronger in recent years. The Queen visited in 2011 and the relationship went from strength to strength. We are now (as it was throughout history) referred to as the "Irish problem" when speaking about the backstop. But the truth is we have always been aware of the English upper class arrogance and watching from here has been very frustrating. We are now directly going to be affected by the arrogance of the "Britannia rules the waves" mentality and we had no say. Thankful that Europe has had our back and hopeful that they will still have it once this goes completely pear shaped if certain people have their way.
0/0	Trying to blackmail everybody to accept May's deal. Pretty obvious why it's being done.

0/0/0/0/0	UK is essentially cutting it's nose to spite the face. Brexit will bring nothing but hardship and economic and political problems and it will hurt both sides - but UK much more than EU.
0/0	UK is finished
1/-1	UK is funding EU with a gross amount of 20 Billion Pounds. That's what is in the news.
1/1	UK is getting ready to surrender its sovereignty and be governed by UNELECTED and UNACCOUNTABLE WTO bureaucrauts from Switzerland!
0/0	UK is not leaving the EU ( still need to put to the budget for this year. Still need to follow EU regulations till end of the year ). What UK do they just leave from EU parliament and they do not have representative there. That’s it !
0/0	UK is now the laughing stock of Europe
0/0	UK is part of the European Union. Looking at the past decades at the level of fundamental values, the European Union has achieved peace, democracy and respect for human rights in a large and growing part of the continent of Europe. The UK’s secession would weaken this transformative achievement. Overall, the evidence supports a common-sense view that British interests are best served by continuing membership of the EU.
0/0/0	UK is suddenly looking like a banana republic
1/1	UK is the country that needs less from EU and was the most visioned country to live and work
1	UK is the richest and strongest  member of EU. We are a world power.  It's better for UK to form it's own union with the Commonwealth states. UK with Australia and NZ. We can then have better control of immigration, trade and money. A much better alternative than trash EU!
1/1	UK is too big, needs no one. Uk gonna make huge deals with the world, make a lot of money
1/1	UK just got away from Future Northern ISIS...
0/0	UK leavers must realise that they have walked away from 400 millions customers. Nothing can replace that, absolutely nothing. All that will happen is UK will have to adhere to CE quality control on all imports or UK get no access. It will be an EU red line.

1/-1	UK never fully embraced the EU anyway. Didn't switch to the Euro and many other things.
1/1	UK never fully embraced the EU anyway.  Didn't switch to the Euro and many other things.
1/1	UK out of the EU is a good thing, for Germany at least and most members, UK is too much a special snow flake so let them rely on the banking sector. Nothing can go wrong.
0/0	UK politicians will always blame the EU, but themselves. Brexiteers would blame anyone, but themselves. Start taking responsibility for the mess you have made out of UK and the world. There is still time to stop it
1/1/1	UK saved themselves at the end from ethnic genocide good job. Now send all the freeloaders from ME and Africa back.
0/0	UK seems to be wanting to revive the Empire days. not gonna happen. so what's now - isolated, spent to the outmost when it comes to "being United Kingdom" and with only friend Trump, who is a Laughing stock of the entire world?
0/0	UK shooting themselves in the foot like the US then claims victory :D lol rich

1/1	UK should now become fully independent and be the light in this dark world and the powerhouse economy of the world through proper manufacturing and business deals and NOT Through Banking and Speculation Trades.All the Best for the Uk.
0/0	UK should stay in the EU, they need to grow and become a super-power once again. EU is not a Super-power without Britain.
0/0	UK should've stayed. All those who wish ill for europeans are happy about you leaving. The Russians, the Arabs, the Chinese... wrong move. Now you're isolated and alone. What's it worth?
0/0	UK stands at the crossroads - either cancel Brexit or ending up as puppet of Putin and Trump
1/0	UK time to change - Scotland should stay with us and get €..Brexit showed how badly country can be effected leaving it.

0/0	UK trying to kick everyone but Europe still allows them free movement
0/0	UK voted itself to irrelevance today. Or to put it more accurately... England. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and maybe even Gibraltar, will likely leave her soon.
0/0	UK want to get out from EU and expect EU give them a better deal?? That's a bunch of non-sense expectation. If EU gives UK better deal, then more and more country will bail out, basically, kill themselves
1/1	UK wants to leave EU because UK does not like the ways Brussel telling UK what to do.
1	UK was always a great country don’t let it down now when it really needs his ppl u gotta be reasonable and except changes EU was greatfull to have UK on their side not the opposite UK is the greatest country on the world after USA so they have to start being that country
1/1	UK was fine before EU and they will be fine after, just hope EU won't try to make things harder for UK in the future.. You know that those unelected bureaucrats at EU are worried that UK will be successful and that other European country will follow Britain's lead.
0/0	UK was one of the countries I wanted to work as a researcher in the future. Now that is out of the EU, I'll have to focus on other countries. UK has just lost a bunch of important future workers with high GPD.
0/1	UK was the biggest recipient of Marshall Plan aid. Received much more than W. Germany. You appear not to know basic European history. Small wonder Brexit excites you.
1/1	UK was the second highest net contributor to the EU's budget after Germany

0/1/0	UK will become the poor little sister begar of Europe who cry for help!
0/0	UK will fall hard
0/0	UK will regret this. The EU is bigger than you and your economy depends heavily on the EU. What if they decide not to deal with you, what happens to your citizens. Has Johnson (Trump in disguise) thought of this?
0/0	UK will still be in europe an island cant move.
1/-1	UK will survive brexit despite the politicians, dont panic and carry on. There is a lot of negativity spread by lobbies.
1/1	UK will take back evrything that belongs to UK

1/1	UK, get out now before they flood you with forced migration
1/1	UK, how about LEAVE NOW? :D You voted, please act immediately!
0/0	UK: I'm going to jump of this ship soon. I'm the best swimmer in the world, I won't even get wet, I don't like anybody on this ship and it will sink soon anyway. EU: we don't want you to jump but it's up to you. UK: and we want you to beg us to stay, a life jacket and free access to this ship without having to comply to the ship's rules. EU: actually you still owe us money so you won't get anything unless you pay. We created this ship together and we still think it's more safe than anything we had before but it's up to you. 3 years later: UK: OK, you had lots of chances to negotiate with me but you were not reasonable, I'm going to actually jump off ... and mark my words; if anything bad happens to me I'm going to blame YOU !
1/-1	UK: “We are independent”
0/0	UKs greatest import WAS cheap labour when they needed it
1/1	USA and UK should also get out of NATO the other countries is basically leeching off USA and UK
1/1	USA and UK together against leftism, Post modernism and globalism.
1/0	USA would be dancing after brexit as that would mean easy way for USA to get deals from weaker EU and weaker UK
1/1	Udder! Udder! pretentious midget, talks way too much, loves the limelight, thinks he's witty, he's just a mouthy midget living high on the hog. BREXIT or bloody revolution.
0/0	Uh oh!! And now reality sets in. Good luck UK!

0/-1	Uk: we´re stronger alone Scots: ok we´ll leave the uk then UK: no no together we´re stronge
0/1	Un fucking believable what you gonna say to the influx on high skilled indians taking our jobs ?
1/1	Unbelievable discussion... The chance for those in ‘power’ to give ‘power’ to the people is now. The Brexit vote goes to the heart of that. People voted to be given control over their laws, borders and money. So let’s stop talking about it and deliver it.
0/0	Unbelievable that Brexiters think the EU can threaten the EU with not paying the £39bn... it means nothing to the EU.
1/1	Unbelievable welcomed sound.thank you Nigel,Boris & democracy.
0/0	Unbelievable, just as unbelievable anything to do with brexit has been. This nonsense must end soon, brexit has failed on all counts.
1/-1	Uncertainty...totally the opposite...the UK knows where we are going....heavy hearts...we are totally elated....we are the UK...
0/0	Under May’s plan, the size of the UK economy would be 3.9% smaller after 15 years, compared with staying in the EU, assuming some trade frictions and net zero inflow of EU migrants, according to an analysis by the UK Treasury.
0/0	Under any scenario, the UK’s exit from the European Union will leave the country worse off.
1/1	Understand this remaining fool. The economy was way down the list of reasons we voted to leave. Understand this remaining fool. It still is. Control of our borders, our laws and our lives came long before any financial risk
1/1	Unelected bureaucrats making it difficult to leave their Union
0/-1	Unemployment, businesses going to the wall, price increases of 25%.Sick and tired of Little Englander idiots. Any business exporting to Europe must be horrified on what is happening
0/0	Unfair! I was a remainer living in a leave area.
0/-1	Unfortunately 17.4m people voted to leave, The Conservatives were returned to power with a majority. If the will of the country was to remain then we'd have seen a Labour Government or a coalition of remain parties. By defination a majority of the country didn't want to remain.
0/0	Unfortunately England has more than their fair share of bigots and morons.
0/0	Unfortunately I think for a lot of Out people they feel like they have no control or ability to affect their lot and the Out campaign has done a good job selling the magic bean that is leaving the EU could be. If we leave I fear they will just be left holding the beans whilst the country becomes further divided.
0/0	Unfortunately it will happen and it will be most unpleasant. An orgy of blitz inspired chauvinism and anti european sentiment.
0/0	Unfortunately my passport renewal time is here and this #probrexit offering has arrived today 😢 #Brexit #StillEuropean #ScotlandIsOpen #ScotlandLovesEU 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🇪🇺
1/1/1	Unfortunately the media and all the luvvies were remoaners it will be their pathetic little stance ! Doesn’t change the fact we’re out the world hasn’t imploded and the interest rates are held in anticipation of an upturn in the economy !
0/1	Unfortunately we have the same here in Germany. Every household here has to pay more than 17,-EUR per month, for our daily dose of anti-conservative, anti-Brexit, anti-Trump and pro-climate scam propaganda.
0/0	Unfortunately, more and more people in the EU are voicing joy about the UK leaving. It's a sad state of affairs, totally on the head of reckless Brexiteers. Maybe to should be taken to court for treason.
1/1	Unfortunately, the EU Commission is not concerned with actual people or countries. They are there for 'The Project'. They've brought Europe the glories of the CAP and the Euro; who knows what they'll do next. But we can be sure it own't be logical or sensible.
0/0	Unhappy Independence Day for us 48% that knows this is one big mistake Brexit. Celebrate today you regret it later
1/1	United Europe turned into a dictatorship. The leave vote was a great decision. Britain is once again democratic.
1/1	United Europe turned into a dictatorship. The leave vote was a great decision. Britain is once again democratic. Let's be clear it is not the voters that forced Britain to leave the EU, it was EU that forced the voters

0/0/1/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	United Kingdom will regret leaving the european union.
0/0	United States of Europe is a good idea in the long term, don't know why people are so afraid of it.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	United we are strong, apart we fall apart
0/0	United we are,better we are,no brexit..
0/0	United we stand, divided we fall. This now applies to the world. The end is near? The world had better unite or it is all over folks.
0/0	United we stand, separate we fail. It is always easy to leave the boat when it smells ashes but leaving is weak and selfish.
0/0	United you stand. Divided you go extinct.
0/0	United you stand. Divided you go extinct. Humans will never unite, so extinction it is. Just a matter of time. Mark my words.
0/0	Unless the British government changes its stance on Brexit sharpish I don't imagine that the uk as we know it will exist in ten years. If Theresa May wants to be remembered as the PM who destroyed the UK then she should keep to her present course. If that's not how she'd like us to think of her in our dotage then a new approach would be wise.
0/0/0	Unless the EU collapses in the next crisis the UK shot themselves in the face.
0/0	Unless you are a Farage or Rees Mog, and have plenty of cash riding on the outcome, the results are a disaster.
1/0	Unlike many other countries in the EU the UK is a rules based society that was always going to find the false straightjacket of the EU impossible to live with - we were never going to settle into the EU - This new adventure is as exciting as it is scary, but is so much better than staying in.
1/1	Unlike you, I, in my very early 30's, deplored the attempts to join the Common Market and in particular, Mr Heath's lies about no loss of sovereignty when he took us in without consulting us. I seized the opportunity to vote to leave in 1975, but was outvoted. Everything I feared then, over the next 40 years happened, though even I had not foreseen the madness of the common currency. I have to say I did foresee all the other ghastly things that have happened like the corruption and the profligacy, like the ECJ and the toothless parliament. Thank God we are now out.
0/0/0	Unlucky 🇬🇧
1/1	Unraveling of the EU wouldn't lead to the dissolution of the EU. It'll become something like the Eurzone, a club of nations where there's no rules other than the whims of the German Chancellor
0/0	Until last week, we were full members. We are still in transition. You chose vassalage, supposedly well aware of what that would entail, and now you’re complaining! Brexilogic.
0/-1/0	Until the Scots vote of independence
0/0	Until the government solidify a position of what post EU Britain will be and what they are going to change their are no pros that are in anyway measurable or even realistic at this stage.
1/1	Up n at em!! Wonderful morning here, lovely bath this morning, soaked in those left wing remainer tears! #NeverCorbyn #BackBoris #ProBrexit #goodbyecultofcorbyn
1/1	Up until we joined this federalist-inclined, supra-national superstate, we controlled our own destiny and made peace and war in Europe according to what policy best furthered our interests.
1/-1	Up you ante, UK, put your money, where… well, you know. But please, make sure you see it through this time. Too good to be part? Fair enough, and fairwell. We wish you no ill. Just don’t come back anytime soon.

1	Very biased anti Breit propaganda: disgusting!
0/-1	Very disappointing was expecting Boris to poke his head through the letterbox at Number 10 and fire off just a single Party Popper
0/0	Very few of the people who voted for Brexit will realise the cost of Brexit. Once it becomes impossible to deny things have got worse, their media will find a non-Brexit scapegoat. A news outlet whose demographic is strongly Brexit isn't going to tell their readers Brexit (and therefore their own action)  is the cause of their problems. The readers won't accept it, they'll just switch to someone with a different story that doesn't make them feel bad.
0/0	Very few people understood what they were voting for
1/-1	Very good
1/1	Very happy about it. And not just because it gets us out of the EU, but also cause the radical progressives and socialists got crushed in the election.
1/1	Very happy for the UK! But I hope you're ready to fight, cuz now they're gonna tear Scotland out of the UK.
1/1	Very happy for them !!
1/0	Very happy that UK is leaving the EU! Hope Scotland joins the EU.
1/1/1	Very interesting to see that many who regret our departure from the EU are still posting furiously. Listen chaps, you’re talking to the air now; since the election you have been politically castrated. We have left the EU and any subsequent negotiations with the EU will be conducted without your influence. We know you expect, and indeed secretly hope, that this all ends in tears, but frankly we do not believe you, and even if there are problems we regard our national independence to be of greater importance. Goodbye and good riddance.
1/1	Very powerful article. Remoaners should read it and be ashamed. But they probably won't. We ordinary British already
1/1	Very proud to finally have the Prime Minister we’ve been waiting for!!

1/1	Vote leave mainly because Cadbury moved factory to Poland 2011 with EU grant. Ford Transit moved to Turkey 2013 with EU grant. Jaguar Land Rover has recently agreed to build a new plant in Slovakia with EU grant, owned by Tata, the same company who have trashed our steel works and emptied the workers pension funds. Peugeot closed its Ryton (was Rootes Group) plant and moved production to Slovakia with EU grant. British Army's new Ajax fighting vehicles to be built in SPAIN using SWEDISH steel at the request of the EU to support jobs in Spain with EU grant, rather than Wales. Dyson gone to Malaysia, with an EU loan. Crown Closures, Bournemouth (Was METAL BOX), gone to Poland with EU grant, once employed 1,200. M&S manufacturing gone to far east with EU loan. Hornby models gone. In fact all toys and models now gone from UK along with the patents all with with EU grants. Gillette gone to eastern Europe with EU grant. Texas Instruments Greenock gone to Germany with EU grant. Indesit at Bodelwyddan Wales gone with EU grant. Sekisui Alveo said production at its Merthyr Tydfil Industrial Park foam plant will relocate production to Roermond in the Netherlands, with EU funding. Hoover Merthyr factory moved out of UK to Czech Republic and the Far East by Italian company Candy with EU backing. ICI integration into Holland’s AkzoNobel with EU bank loan and within days of the merger, several factories in the UK, were closed, eliminating 3,500 jobs Boots sold to Italians Stefano Pessina who have based their HQ in Switzerland to avoid tax to the tune of £80 million a year, using an EU loan for the purchase. JDS Uniphase run by two Dutch men, bought up companies in the UK with £20 million in EU 'regeneration' grants, created a pollution nightmare and just closed it all down leaving 1,200 out of work and an environmental clean-up paid for by the UK tax-payer. They also raided the pension fund and drained it dry. UK airports are owned by a Spanish company. Scottish Power is owned by a Spanish company. Most London buses are run by Spanish and German companies. The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to be built by French company EDF, part owned by the French government, using cheap Chinese steel that has catastrophically failed in other nuclear installations. Now EDF say the costs will be double or more and it will be very late even if it does come online. Swindon was once our producer of rail locomotives and rolling stock. Not any more, it's Bombardier in Derby and due to their losses in the aviation market, that could see the end of the British railways manufacturing altogether even though Bombardier had EU grants to keep Derby going which they diverted to their loss-making aviation side in Canada. 39% of British invention patents have been passed to foreign companies, many of them in the EU The Mini cars that Cameron stood in front of as an example of British engineering, are built by BMW mostly in Holland and Austria. His campaign bus was made in Germany even though we have Plaxton, Optare, Bluebird, Dennis etc., in the UK. The bicycle for the Greens was made in the far east, not by Raleigh UK but then they are probably going to move to the Netherlands too as they have said recently. Anyone who thinks the EU is good for British industry or any other business simply hasn't paid attention to what has been systematically asset-stripped from the UK. Name me one major technology company still running in the UK, I used to contract out to many, then the work just dried up as they were sold off to companies from France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, etc., and now we don't even teach electronic technology for technicians any more, due to EU regulations. I haven't detailed our non-existent fishing industry the EU paid to destroy, nor the farmers being paid NOT to produce food they could sell for more than they get paid to do nothing, don't even go there. I haven't mentioned what it costs us to be asset-stripped like this, nor have I mentioned immigration, nor the risk to our security if control of our armed forces is passed to Brussels or Germany. Find something that's gone the other way, I've looked and I just can't. If you think the EU is a good idea, 1/ You haven't read the party manifesto of The European Peoples' Party. 2/ You haven't had to deal with EU petty bureaucracy tearing your business down. 3/ You don't think it matters.

0/0/-1	Voters reserve the right to change their minds. 00% and yet Europe should also reserve the right to say NO, as we have had enough.
0/0	Voting for Brexit is like voting for TRUMP.
0/0	Voting for Brexit was the second worst voter decision in history.
0/0	Voting remain because the EU brought better human rights is like voting for Labour because it brought the NHS.
1/1	Voting remain won't even maintain the weird status quo we have at the moment which is the result of brushing all sorts of dreadful issues and decisions under the rug until we have voted. Anyone who votes remain will watch a horror unfold as Europe shafts us before falling apart.
0/0/0/0	Voting remain, it's pretty like that if with leave, Scotland will want independence in order to be in the EU. This will result in a constant Tory government as Scotland's vote for Labour is vital in preventing the Conservatives (as can be seen in the last election). Being from the North, that idea terrifies me
0/0	Voting requires adequate information, a good grasp of the facts and basic common sense.brexit was based on poor and unreliable information, lack of knowledge, denial of facts and the results defied all common sense.
0/0	Voting to leave just because of immigration is a really dumb thing to do, you have to look at the others ways, at economic reasons it would be better to stay in the EU, since many migrants pay more taxes than british people.
1/1	Voting to leave the EU to protect British workers and our NHS, Stop TTIP, Regain our sovereignty and self determination.
0/0	Voting to leave the EU was foolhardy
1/1	Voting to leave, voting for a United Kingdom, voting for self government, voting for a say in the laws and policies my government brings in, voting for no taxation without representation, voting for accountability for laws brought in, voting for control of the borders to keep out foreign criminals and terrorists, voting to control the numbers of economic migrants to the UK, voting for self determination, voting for my country, voting for liberty, voting for our laws, voting for the right not to be ruled by foreigners.
1/1/1	Voting to remain in the EU is like chickens voting for KFC.
0/0/1	Voting to stay in the EU, simply because I haven't seen enough sufficient evidence that we'll better off by leaving. It just seems like a rash, risky and not very well thought through decision to cut ourselves out already, plus all the vote leave fear-mongering is hardly warming me to their cause. I'd rather for the time being that Europe stuck together and tried to work through the current issues it faces. At least the EU can protect certain laws. I also like how connected and mobile our current generation are. I worry that if our leaving became a catalyst for a more fragmented Europe it would set things back, e.g. more unrest, war, nationalism.
0/0/0/0	Voting to stay in. We are stronger in Europe - not just economically. The EU is an amazing thing - all these countries who've fought each other - working together. I'm proud to be English & I'm proud to be part of the EU too.
0/0	Voting to stay, not least because it makes the most sense politically, economically and otherwise, but also because the leave campaign seems to be pointing a lot of fingers without really offering solutions. It's important to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against. Many British ties to European have been renegotiated anyway, so a large part of problems those in favour of Brexit seem to point out will be resolved through that. Much of the rest of their problems are issues like UK nationals living abroad 'draining' health care resources, which, to me, doesn't really have too much to do with whether or not Britain is part of the EU.
1/1	Vox You didn't mention the Eu also controls the 60% of laws and wish to have more power. The right to be governed by the people you elect is what England voted for.

1/1	WOW--Where did all the LEADERS and INFLUENCERS GO---As LEAVING THE EU caused our TITLED COMMENTATORS to desert the UK, because now we REAL BREXIT BRITONS will have no one to show and demonstrate our superior mental agility and knowledge.---Ah -almost forgot--there is still the matter of stopping a certain EU tyrant called Martin Selmayr --who ( allegedly ) had a Grand father who was jailed for war crimes, this Mr Selmayr as given himself the top job by the side of Mr Juncker as 2IC to the EU executive.---He is a NOTED ANGLOPHOBE-- a man with no liking of Great Britain or America--no doubt fully due to the good flogging the war time Allies gave to the arrogant NATIONAL "Socialist" hierarchy of Hitlers German war machine.--Some Memories take a long time to disappear, and no doubt Britain's past success's will be a hard bit for Herr Selmayr, and many other EU officials, to swallow.
1/1	WTF is the point of having a vote if the result isn't honoured?
1/1	WTO Australia style is fine for UK
1/1	WTO is the way to go
1/1	WTO, the way to go! No foreign power making 70% of our laws. No undemocratic Empire. Nobody telling us who can live here. No British blood spilt on whatever Imperialist adventure the Grande Armee Morgherini embarks on. I humbly suggest other captive nations examine the implications of their own predicament.

0/0	Waking up this morning, it is heartbreaking to see my news feed is full of thoroughly dejected people. Most of these are young, intelligent and passionate, individuals who were determined to support integration, tolerance and compassion. Yet, our futures have been governed by the votes of narrow-minded older generations who now will sit back and see our bright futures dimmed. I am embarrassed and disappointed that our country has been manipulated by the xenophobic, racist and above all incorrect facts that have been spread. Nigel Farage stated that leaving the EU is a victory for the ordinary, decent people – today I am proud to be exceptionally indecent.
0/0	Wales &Scotland DO NOT WANT BREXIT and much of N.Ireland if wasn't for the Ulster loyalist to the crown. REVOTE have another REFERENDUM!! The first was like 2016 USA presidential election where nearly 25% or more didn't vote LAZY thinking the crazy impossible would never get selected.

0/0	Watched the news yesterday and they interviewed some people in in pro Brexit areas as to what their thoughts wereAlmost all responses involved either:Happy we won't be oppressed by Euro law anymoreHappy we won't send Brussels money anymoreYet none of them could actually explain what laws oppressed them (and yes they really used the term oppressed) or how knew much money the UK got from Europe.The most telling bit was when it was pointed out that one of the big subsidized projects in Cornwall would no longer get money from the European grant the response was: Well then our government will just have to fund that.I honestly cannot wait for the boomer generation to no longer be part of the electorate.
0/0	Watching in horror from Canada, I just feel sorry for all the decent people of Britain. All 48% of ‘em.

1/1	We Leavers are not interested in what Adonis thinks or wants, he’s a bit late we had the Referendum in 2016 and this is just an excuse to stop Brexit. Well, if you spit in the face of 17.4 million voters who won the Referendum don’t be surprised when there is a monumental backlash. BEWARE WHAT YOU DO.

0/-1	We all know the main reason of the break-up is the immigration chrisis, just stop hiding this from the media and say it out loud
0/0	We already are a sovereign country, which is why we can make the decision to leave in the first place. All this decision has done is make the UK the laughing stock of the world.
0/0/1	We already could trade virtually everywhere. And on very favourable terms by dint of having EU clout behind us. Now we are minnows waiting to be snared by little nets. EU “red tape” is a Golden Chisel into foreign markets.

0/1	We also benefit within the UK from the lower costs for unskilled labour that EU migrants bring.
0/0	We always said - long before the idea of Brexit took shape - that it is in our interests to have a united, strong, and most importantly independent European Union
1/1/1	We are 100% better off outside the EU. I am sure Boris will get the best deal he can, but we can help ourselves by buying British and supporting our own farmers and producers.

0/0	We are one of them (and we design and build exhibitions all over the EU, buy one product from Belgium supplier, sell it to UK, France, Spain... and work a fair bit in Germany. Economic ‘bumps’ are secondary to sovereignty. We recover from the former, never from the latter.
1	We are out of Schengen, we are out of he Euro and come 29th march 2019 we are out of the Eu ... Once we are out, if the people are ever so stupid as to vote back in we would have to give up the pound. and harmonise our taxes to the Eu , the end aim is total and complete Political union . Where we are may not be totally perfect but the other direction to leaving on 29th March 2019 is one I never want to go down.
1/1	We are out!!!

0/1	We can only keep fighting and hope that this ludicrous situation will be resolved quickly. Get us into the EEA quickly and lets avoid a huge mess up to our economy.
0/1	We can solve the migrant issue by leaving. Half our migrants come from outside Europe. Even if we leave wont be able to close the net migration to bellow 200,000. So no leaving will not solve the issue.
1/1	We can sue the EU for our £60 Billion in assets and money under International Law and we would win.
0	We can't now stop #Brexit. The UK has left the EU. But, every single person who cares about our country should be supporting the government getting the best possible deal with the EU before the end of the transition period. Anyone who disagrees with this is not a true patriot!
1/1	We can't trust the EU, we have never been able to trust the EU, They have no respect for the UK, So please stop refering to them as our freinds. The Ink is hardley dry on the W.A.and they are already gonig back on what they have agreed. As they have already broken the agreement we are fee to walk away.

0/0	We can’t vote our way out of this. We are, always will be European.
0/0	We champion freedom - but Brexit will mean the next generation is less free to live, work and love across Europe.

1/1	We did not even have a chance to join the EU, they just made us and now we have to pay millions
0/1	We did not lose Europe we voted to ditch the corrupt EU.
0/0	We did not make any promises other than brexit will be a disaster in about 3-10 years that any GCSE student of modern global business studies will likely tell you why..
1/-1/1	We did not vote for a deal we voted out. Not to sighn up for more

1/1	We didn't vote to do deals we voted to leave the sooner we leave the sooner we get back to full employment
0/0	We didn’t transfer our powers to Brussels. We carried our powers to Brussels, and used them there, for the good of all Europe, for nearly half a century. Now this era of contribution has come needlessly to an end. I’m angry. And heartbroken.
1/1	We do NOT want continued instructions off the EU. We do NOT want level playing fields as that takes away the benefits of being a FREE and independent COUNTRY again. We can sustain a few blips after we gain our freedom in Dec 2020. It is NOT our responsibility to pay in yet more money into the EU to save Germany, Italy and Greece from recession and the EU from possible collapse.
1/1	We do not need to stay close to the EU. Why would we want to do that after all these years of wanting to LEAVE. As a Back Bencher you have very little to say that any one would want to hear. You replacement has now been selected. It is time to nip home and start packing.
1/1	We do not owe or trust the Merchants of greed, this is not about the British brexit they fear, but the aspirations of the rest of Europe, to free itself of a morally corrupt, and anti democratic EU.
1/1	We do not want or need a second vote, no matter what the 'Economist' says! We voted OUT!
0/0	We don't need Extra Time. About time we blew the whistle for Full Time and cancelled the disastrous fiasco that is Brexit
1/1/1	We don't need a deal! We must LEAVE without a deal as said. Simple there is no other option.
1/1/1	We don't need a trade deal with the EU we can be also more competitive without one. The EU needs a trade deal as it's worth £80 billion to them but only about half that to us so when they speak of level playing field the need to look at the deficit on us caused by them.
0/0	We don't need food.We can eat fresh brexit.?

0/0	We don't need to leave the EU to fix our problems.
0/0	We don't technically have to leave as the referendum wasn't legally binding. The government could just go for a soft brexit where they remain in the European Economic Area or just ignore the brexit and hope that the deciding 2% changed their minds.

1/1	We don't want a backstop, we don't want an agreement, we just want out. We want out immediately.
1/1	We don't want a bloody deal just get us out
1/1	We don't want an United Europe, under EU leadership the common man and women in all EU nation states are tired of unelected regulation. The only benefit is the visa free travel, but that also allows radicalized individuals to travel throughout Europe under the radar, it's what led to the Rotherham rapes here in the UK, The issues in Koln, Sweden becoming the rape Capitol of Europe. This vote was half to do with immigration reform and half to do with us in the middle classes being tired of being ruled by an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels where they can't even properly police the area around Brussels and have caused massive debts to be accumulated by private banks that hurt the EuroZone economically. This is a needed change, it's time to tear down the EU and rebuild the country's inside the EU to be self-sufficient while partnering with other European countries in order to maintain true stability for the common man.

1/1	We had a BREXIT in 1776. Things worked out pretty well not having a foreign power lord over us and taxing us.
1/1	We had a vote no deal bye bye EU adiós amigos 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
1/1	We had an empire before the "EU" came into the picture.
1/1	We had the people's vote - called Brexit
1/1	We had the people's vote - called Brexit.
1/1	We hand over £55 Million every day to be told how to behave! There is nothing about this EU that attracts.
1/1	We have NO chance of a new style government whilst we are members.. LEAVE and then take control of our political elite .. The ones we can vote IN or OUT at elections… But if we remain than bad government is what we will get forever. VOTE LEAVE
1/1/1	We have a government that will make a success of Brexit. It's also the first one in many decades that I haven't completely despised.
1/1	We have a massive trade deficit with the EU...we spend billions more importing than we export to the EU. If we refuse to give the £39 billion, and withdraw our trade...the EU will implode and come back cap in hand begging for trade deals...this isn¿t rocket science.
0/0	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet.
0/0	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet. If our MPs don't let the people vote on #Brexit they will be held responsible for ignoring warnings from business leaders like Tom Enders.
1/1/1	We have already voted for brexit what is this man talking about ?
0/0	We have an agreement with the Faroe Islands! What a mess. Britain seems intent on committing economic suicide but at least the migrants will stop coming when it all hits the fan, and it will hit the fan.
0/1	We have at least a decade of brexit, politicians trying to tell us that chlorine chicken is fine because our trade deal with the US for our banks is great.
1/1	We have become a sovereign country again after 47 years of deception by our political class, may that pave the way for freedom & justice for all, even those who opposed it, many thanks to those who stood up to the abuse, your efforts have been rewarded!
1/1	We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise.
1/1	We have been giving money to poor areas but via the EU after they take a massive cut. It is our money always has been. Fed up of hearing about EU funded projects. There is no such thing in this country. We are net contributors.
1/1	We have been lied to endlessly by our very own political class about the economic benefits of remaining a part of the disastrous EU project.
1/1/1	We have broke free from a dictatorship . Our Brexit vote might even bring the whole EU project down. It's not just about money. We are a great country .All the Remain voters are all arrogant big heads ,who talk down to people. I know people like you who i go to school with .These people never fight the system ,they think they are clever.But never clever enough to realise they are being controlled by the elite.
1/1	We have contributed a great deal to Europe in many ways and yet this is what they think of us. Doesn't this suggest we were wrong to join such a club of corrupt politicians and states continuously taking from us?
0/1	We have diplomatically voted to get rid of our paddles to take back control of our canoe
1/1	We have finally taken our country back from the EU after 47 years. I love Britain, Europe and the European people, but strongly oppose the neoliberal and toxic EU: it is a dictatorship. Now let’s put the ‘Great’ back into Britain!
1/-1/-1	We have had foreign government for 47 years. So how did that happen given that our Bill of Rights 1689 prohibits foreign people having jurisdiction in the uk?
1/1	We have left. They are in no position to demand anything.
0/0	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent. You’ve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away.
0/0	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent. You’ve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away. Well done!
1	We have many negotiating tools in our box, including our fishing waters, banking and security industries and of course consumer purchasing power.
0/0	We have more influence in the EU than out of it. Stop Brexit now.
1/1	We have never had any real influence in the EU....another political mirage foisted on the UK public
1/0	We have no chance of ever influencing Europe. It is run by and for Germany and France.
1/0	We have not changed our minds - We need our government to have a back bone and stand up for the people.
0/0	We have one year to stop Brexit happening.
1/1	We have paid in over 100 billion pounds over and above what we have got back. What is our supposed benefit for this one way traffic. Now we will have a vote at last.
1/1	We have regulations and taxes and tariffs that are meant to benefit other EU countries and don’t benefit us.
1/1	We have seen hundreds of thousands of people each year migrate from Eastern Europe to attach themselves to the UK welfare nipple.
0/0	We have simply lost all influence in European decisions and made ourselves vulnerable to US bullying, which has started already. We will continue to comply with EU regulations but have no say whatsoever.
1	We have to VOTE LEAVE for freedom and Democracy away from the Euro Project Dictatorship
0/0	We have to keep eu togheter if we want to ever to be great again
0/0	We have to stay in the eu
1/1	We have tried enough. time to walk away. If anyone is looking clarity tell them no deal.
1/1	We have won a peaceful revolution. We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians and ensured the future of our country for generations to come is one of sovereign democracy. Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris. It’s down to you, all heroes.
1/1	We have won a peaceful revolution. We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians both in the UK and in the global elite and ensured the future of our country for generations to come is one of sovereign democracy. Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris. It’s down to you, all heroes.
1/1/1	We have won the war. We have now entered the post-strife peace negotiations.
0/0	We haven't left yet !!! I found your video Premature, Perhaps you should wait for the 2 years Negotiation period to be completed before bragging about Brexit , currently, not a single EU law has been replaced as result I m not surprised you believe Brexit fears have not materialized
1/1	We hold the cards despite what the remainers keep telling you.
1/1	We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table
1/1	We import a similar amount to our exports to the US so if the US were to make good on this threat to its friend and partner it would damage both economies. Basically the US is saying that it will treat us badly if we seek to regain our independence. With friends like that who needs enemies? Personally I am happy to pay whatever it takes to regain independence.
0/0	We import lots of our food from France, Spain and Italy.
0/0	We import most of our cars from France, Germany and Italy.
0/0	We import most of our oil and coal and much of our gas. How will we have enough electricity to run the freezer, or even the lights?
1/1	We in UK have delivered our verdict on leaving the EU and we do not need to be asked again...
1	We in the USA look forward to a great trade deal with you. Congratulations and #HappyBrexit
1/1	We joined a common market and now left behind the EU which has morphed into something we donâ€™t want to be part of. Freedom starts from today; our own rules and we can trade internationally.
1/1	We joined an economic union back in the 70s, and by the end of the 90s this union had become a political one, which a court and parliament that made ours no long supreme or sovereign. How people can want to preserve this baffles me- I'm willing to accept a few potential years of economic recession if it means self governance. 800 years ago we created the magna carta, and nearly 400 years ago we fought a civil war over the unelected creating laws for the people. The European union in its current state of federalism makes both of these events irrelevant.
1/1	We joined it under the guise of it being a trading bloc and that's categorically not what it is now
1/1	We joined the Common Market because in the 70s the UK was a basket case. Since then the economy shifted from industrial to financial. That makes us a net customer, whereas France and Germany are net producers. While in theory France could punish us with high export tariffs, it's unlikely that they will. Global trade has become much easier in the last thirty years, and the idea of a trade block, while perhaps appropriate in the 60s, is now rather old hat. As a customer able to shop elsewhere, we have an advantage.
1/1	We just don't want to be part of this federation that has assumed more and more powers over time, without any votes or say so of the citizens.
1	We just want to be citizens of our own countries - not EU citizens.
1/1	We knew exactly what we were doing when we voted to leave, we understand the meaning of the verb ‘to leave’, and what they are thinking of serving up is absolutely nothing like leaving” #brexit
1/1	We knew exactly what we were voting for. We were asked if we wanted to leave the EU and we said yes.
1/1	We leave in March, if we don't have a withdrawal agreement in place or a trade agreement so be it. That can be done outside of the EU.
1/1	We leave in March. No problem
1/0	We leave on 29th March or parliament loses all authority. They are writing their own suicide notes. This is a matter of democracy and all these remainer MPs are going to find themselves on the wrong side of history.
1	We leave regardless because we have a destiny outside vanilla Europe. They stand in our way at their peril.
1/1	We leaving about time the dirty scummy twats
1	We left I'm so happy now just hurry up with the process
1/1	We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services
1/1	We left the EU because we want to control our own borders, laws, keep our nation sovereign. We've always been the pariahs of Europe and it's natural for us to forge our own individual destiny.
1/1	We left yayyyyyy
0/-1	We left. No regulatory alignment or there’s no point of leaving
0/0	We left........ We’re going to collapse
1/1	We liberated europe a long time ago and since then we have poured billions into their economy , its now time to liberate the UK .
1/1/1	We like visiting Europe but we despise the EU. Anti-EU is NOT anti-Europe. Britain is a sovereign nation. THIS is a good day!
0/0	We like you, Brits, but you make it difficult, considering the mess you put us all into... still, we like you. Think this thoroughly, please.
1/1	We live in a period where buying British has gone , but now we are independent it gives us hope . Hope that British businesses will once again be successful and steadfast
0/0	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on
0/0	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on,. Very backward way of thinking.
1/1	We look forward to doing business with a FREE and INDEPENDENT Britain
1/1	We love the people of Europe, we just don't want to be ruled by their crooks. We already have enough of our own to deal with. And we will deal with them: our house - our rules.
1/1	We made our decision to Leave.
1/1	We make decisions for the best interests
1/1	We make more medicines in the UK than the whole EU, including France.
0/0/-1	We may be strong economically, but so is Chipping Norton, and no one would suggest they could survive as an independent entity.
0/0	We may be strong economically, but so is Chipping Norton, and no one would suggest they could survive as an independent entity. We are tiny and the sooner we let go of this vision of Britain as the heart of Empire renamed Commonwealth the better.
1/-1	We may have a new Prime Minister, but businesses are still none the wiser on Brexit with less than a 100 days to go until 31 October..
0/1/-1	We might is well stay in it now bored of hearing about now same old story blah blah blah
0/0	We must NEVER give up! Rejoiners unite! Let's be defiant and organise.
1/1	We must have a deal that inflicts maximum damage to the EU.........Lets make them suffer!
1/1	We must leave EU immediately, I don’t want refugees to flow into our country.
1/1	We must leave the EU i don't want to deal with Article 13.
1/1	We must leave the EU.
0/0	We must not underestimate the power of the Daily Mail, the Express or the Sun. For decades, they have fuelled intense hatred of the EU among their uneducated readers. The announcement of a second referendum will be like a red rag to a bull to them - they will launch a ferocious campaign with roaring headlines such as ’NOW the remoaners want to steal the people’s referendum’. The gullible readers, even those who are already suffering from inflation and job losses, will vote leave again.
0/0	We must respond to Brexit with more than yelling
0/0	We must stay in the EU. Employers benefit from free movement, and the ability to move capital and jobs around the trading block (offshoring is a brilliant way to increase competitiveness).
1/0	We must walk away now with no deal boris, no more talking as the remainers in parliament have been blocking Brexit all along. And the EU laughing at us down to the rotten remainers in parliament are doing the same taking the p out of us leave voters. And ignoring the rights of voters who voted to leave the corrupt EU. Keep going boris and get Brexit done with no deal as you have backing 100% leave voters.
1/1	We must win this referendum we must vote LEAVE! We will never get another chance
1	We need Brexit to happen.
0/0	We need MPs who do their job and distantiate themselves from the nonsense that the people really want Brexit. #Brexit is a crime. There is no mandate when you win 52% on lies, stolen private data, social media high-tech and big foreign money.
0/-1	We need a #PeoplesVote. There is no other way out of this mess.
1/1	We need a Prime Minister like President Trump who will take us out of the EU now!!
1/1	We need a foreign central government to rule over us or else we will regress derp derp
1/1	We need a general election to get the traitors out so that we can finally get the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.
0/1	We need a second referendum never allow the chavs to have a brexit
0/0	We need a second referendum. The younger generation should get a vote on Brexit because it affects them just as much
1/1	We need a strong leader who can fight Eurocorruption and cares about people and country, like Nancy Pelosi!
1/1	We need democracy to preserve our freedoms, but we should focus a lot more on the essential freedoms, otherwise even with democratic votes, you might end in a dictatorship. Exhibit A is Germany in the 1930s
0/1	We need no deal, no deal whatsover, for about 5 to 10 years. Yes, economic fur will fly for a few years, but this is absolutely necessary in order to separate out the economic aspects of leaving from the political nonsense from which we must ensure we are entirely free on Brexit day. It is not the cost of leaving the fascist superstate, but rather the cost of ever having joined the fascist superstate in the first place - send the invoice to the estate of the traitor greasy slug Heath, the traitor John Major-Ball the former circus clown and failed bus conductor, and architect of the ERM disaster, and Tony B. Liar, Labour's traitor psychopath and war criminal. Negotiating the economic and trade aspects, together with the "punishment" that we are to receive for having the temerity to leave the fascist superstate, is complete madness. The only thing to do now is to tell the fascist superstate to fwuk off. We should not have any discussions with them for at least 5 years.
1/1	We need people to be positive about Brexit, instead of the constant negativity and scaremongeri.
0/0	We need people to come to the UK and live here for the economy to work by closing the UK off to the EU by not allowing free movement of labour this will mean more jobs in the UK? Wrong we need these people for their labour and it is wrong to assume they all are unskilled. Leaving the EU will be our biggest mistake and will cost the economy another recession and heavily impact the majority of UK citizens over the next ten years.
1/1/-1	We need someone to demonstrate the wrong construction and development of the EU.
0/0	We need the EU because our governments are often irresponsible.
0/0	We need the EU otherwise we are a tiny little island on our own. Just start a new EU and ditch all the nuisance countries (France). The others will follow.
0/0	We need the EU, especially for the future, without it we’re going to have a hard time as single nations in an ever more competitive world.
0/0	We need to #StopBrexit.
1/1	We need to LEAVE - just as stated in the referendum. WTO not this deceitful deal that Olly EU and May cooked up to keep us tied into the crumbling, discredited EU.
0/1	We need to bin the nightmare before it gets much worse.
1/1	We need to dump them NOW, whilst they're in panic mode, so we can destroy their evil empire before they destroy us and Europe!
0/0	We need to end the Brexit madness
1/-1	We need to expedite free trade agreements with the US, Japan, Australia and every other democracy in preference to the EU.
1/1	We need to get off the sinking EU ship as soon as possible.
1/1	We need to get out as soon as possible, their true colours are emerging?.
1/1	We need to get the hated EU out of the UK now by whatever means necessary.
1	We need to get the remainers to take pride in their country. Only if they take pride in their homes will they end up with homes to be proud of. Only if they believe in themselves will they have the chance to achieve great things.
1/1	We need to hang in there and face the EU down.  No blinking until we leave and then lots of flag-waving!
1/1	We need to know and understand what's coming next after Brexit ( with OR without a deal ) - this is what WILL happen. The EU has recognised that our country is a threat to their Superstate project once again. It seems that in every century their efforts to unify and rule the whole of Europe is dashed by the interfering actions of the British - Napoleon (19th Century), Hitler ( 20th Century ) EU Commission ( 21st Century). They will now need to crush us entirely because leaving us alone, to thrive, to prosper, to grow in power and influence, to become an economic competitor right on their doorstep simply cannot be allowed. Remember - Brexit is not just about Britain taking back control, it's also about the EU LOSING control.
1/1	We need to leave ASAP, I as many others did not vote to be controlled by Brussels. The ridiculous amount of money given to the EU every day will help our country recover especially the NHS. Now the EU is allowing the Calais migrants to use their human rights to have their cases heard here so they will all head our way the same as when they drop going to the first country. Genuine Refugees fleeing horrific war zones are in genuine need of help but economic migrants are not. We need to take action and fast track our British Bill of Rights now instead of the summer. The small print though still will allow migrants to exercise their human rights. This should not be allowed in the uk once the British bill is in place. We need leaders to be strong with an iron will and lead us out of the EU I will then once more be proud to be British and no longer afraid for our future.
1/1	We need to leave before the Euro collapses and possibly the EU with it.
1/1	We need to leave but they wont let us !
1/1	We need to leave now and govern ourselves. This is the way that we have succeeded so well in the past
1/1	We need to leave on WTO terms. just out of general principal.. the EU need to learn their lesson.
1/-1/1	We need to make a very large deal with America which is mostly in place to get us started then the rest of the commonwealth before the end of the year.Let's get the ball rolling ASAP !
0/0	We need to make sure that all Brits go home after Brexit. Good bye EHIC, good bye sunshine. Hello social assitance crash.
0/0	We need to pull together not just for a Peoples Vote but to stop Brexit completely and then work so that this does not happen again. The UK badly needs healing.
1/1	We need to regain control of our laws and borders.
1/1	We need to rule our own country! We need to create a more stable immigration system and we need to put British tax payers money into Britain not the EU where it is used to bail out every other country but our own!
1/1	We need to slash foreign aid, the amount of money we send overseas is an absolute joke.
1/1	We need to walk away with no deal
1/1	We need to walk.
0/0	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea
0/0	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea.
0/0	We need unskilled labours. Our workforce is skilled enough as it is. Besides that if we leave 100,000s of our own citizens will have to return to our country many of which can't work. They are elderly and will put further strain on our health care.(which is one of the largest employers of migrants because UK citizens don't want to be nurses) So the NHS may crumble if we choose to leave the EU.
1/1	We never lost Europe we are leaving the EU i thank Cameron at least he did give the people a voice The EU has hyjacked the word EUROPE thank god we voted Leave
1/1	We never lost Europe we got rid of Europe lol it all went right you've talked to politicians all right remainers where's the leavers and Cameron was a snob who didn't think working class would get rid of eu well thank god we did and him as well why did he roll his sleeves up at rallies he's never done a hard day's work in his life
1/1	We never voted for UNION in the first place...thats why this is an anti-climax...we voted to be in a common trading market...NOTHING MORE
1/1	We never voted for a deal,democracy must prevail. If not We will be finished as a sovereign nation.
1/1	We never voted to be ruled by a third party.
1/1	We never were the resistance. The People voted and only remainers wanted to resist. It’s time to stop arguing and get on with it. Peace
1/1	We not need a Brexit we need a Euexit (The EU must go) !
1/1	We now have a country where we can vote out the people who are acting on our behalf in matters politic. Don’t like the direction of travel? You can use your vote. The people under EU rule don’t have that option. They are subject to the whims of appointed managers with a diaphanous veneer of democracy. None of us are involved in the negotitions, nor know how the result will play out. The one thing that is true is that the UK is now more democratic and whichever party forms the government they are no longer constrained by EU dictatorship.
0/0/0	We now know Brexit was rigged by Cambridge Analytica and the Russians.
1/1	We only ever voted to join the common market anyway, not what is now the EU. No wonder we want out.
1/1	We ordinary souls that do not have huge wealth to shelter us and our children want Brexit.
1/1	We owe Europe under ten million pounds, THEY owe us BILLIONS for the cost of Liberating them during WW2.
0/0	We owe the money... if we don't pay it our international reputation and creditworthiness goes down the tube...
1/1	We owe them NOTHING!!!
1/1	We owe them nothing but there will be plenty on here no doubt saying we do. How anyone can agree to giving away 39bn of hard earned taxpayers money when you look all around and see how much we need that money ourselves is beyond me. I don't even think we should pay it if we get a deal. Who in their right mind pays someone just so they can sell us their stuff? Because our exports are more outside the EU than in it. But no doubt we will because our politicians are so weak, it won't effect them but get ready for another 10yrs of austerity to pay for it
0/1	We paid nearly nothing in the bailouts compared to our GDP. Countries half our economic size were paying twice as much
0/0	We pay a lot of money to the EU in fees. For that we get right of access to western Europe and right to travel, work and live where we choose. Europe is 'Our Country' and is at peace. We get the single market and the customs union which means free trade in many countries all around the world. Its great value. We will lose all this at the end of transition and cannot replace the lost trade. Shame.
1/1	We ran the country well enough before BLAIR signed our country over to the EU the people didnt sign it over . Therefore we do not belong to it which means they have no hold over us. So we would like to leave piecefully & be left to bring our country back up to being GREAT BRITAIN again . We would like all the intruders to go back to there own countrys & fight for it not leave it to others to fight for it for them...
1/1	We really don't care any more, just get us out of this monstrosity now
1/1	We really must put most of our efforts into negotiating trade deals with the rest of the World. The bureaucratic EU will drone on and on, for month after month, with little or no progress being made.
1/1	We really should just leave. Mrs May, get a backbone and tell the EU what to do!
0/0	We remainers must now aim for Britain to do well – and the EU even better
1/1	We right behind you Boris. power to the people . @JamesLarkhill @BorisJohnson you are the Man
1/1	We rule Britannia again! 🇬🇧
1/0/1	We saved Europe in two wars, we were the British empire, we are quite capable of going it alone. We still have the commonwealth and the rest of the world to trade with. No deal immediately and then start negotiating a deal. Cut of the fish today and they will agree a deal tomorrow.
1/1	We see young people wandering on streets with no jobs. Skill them and employ them. Do not make excuses to remain in the EU
0/0	We shall be no more independent, less global, and with a very uncertain future.
0/0	We should be fixing our problems instead of leaving the EU.
0/0	We should be shouting to stop Brexit
1/1	We should celebrate our escape from this badly thought out EU project. It was not what we signed up for all those years ago. I for one will end my dry January with drink or 2.
1/1	We should celebrate our new freedom
0/0	We should do what they say. We are going to need to stay on good terms so when the Brexit disaster fails like we said it would we can march Farage to the EU parliament to get down on his hands and knees and beg Juncker to let us back in and admit he was wrong and we might have a chance of being accepted back in.
1/1	We should do what trump said. Sue the EU . The macron led agenda against the UK is also against EU rules. Sooner we leave the better. That is why nearly all leave voters just want out now.
1/1	We should have never joined the EEC/EU in the first place (in my view).
0/0	We should have only allowed people who can tie their own shoelaces to vote. If we had that there’d be no Brexit!
0/0	We should have to prepare for the referendum for not to leave EU
1/1	We should insist that the EU follow our rules
1/1	We should just leave then start to make deals
1/1	We should leave the EU and form a new trading block with the nations of the commonwealth. I'm not afraid of leaving the EU in the slightest. If they need us they can come knocking cap in hand. That's the way it will be not the other way round.
1/1	We should leave the EU. I just hope that when we do, this government does get stricter on immigration and has an Aussie style points system. But knowing the tories they won't because their big business chums, LOVE immigration. If we leave the EU, France and Finland should follow suit.
1/1	We should leave. The EU is worthless as is. Governs with back to its citizens, and not because it’s leading them. EU has other interests in mind which are not those of it’s citizens or Europe.
1/1	We should listen to the very people that never listened to us, well sorry but our day has come and you can do what you made us do over the decades, sit back and take it.
1/1	We should not negotiate with the EU until after we leave. There is no point.
0/0/0	We should of stayed in the EU.
0	We should remain with the EU, however some adjustments could and should be made especially to benefits and housing of immigrants.
1/1	We should stop buying German/French cars and buy Japanese or Korean ones and exchange French wines for GB/US/Australian/ Sth. American wines. The UK is a MASSIVE market and they need our pounds. Time for Made In UK stickers on all products to give consumers more information on the choices they make in the supermarket. I for one would pay a little bit extra just to stick two fingers up at the EU.
0/1	We should wait for those deals and see if UK businesses really benefit being outside of the EU single market
1/1	We shouldn't have become so dependent on EU systems IN THE FIRST PLACE ! Time to develop our own system and infrastructure with some of the 39 Billion saved if no deal !!
1/1	We simply must leave on WTO terms...Europe is in a federalistic mess.
0	We start the campaign to remain now. More people now want in than out
1/0	We still have TWO years to clearly say Britain exit is ACTUALLY a huge blow to other EU nations . A nation who kept their Currency intact even while staying in EU can do lot even if they are out of it!
1/1	We still have every chance of winning this. Vote leave!
1/1	We support Brexit but that does not make us bad guys
1/1	We support Brexit here in the US.  Many of us here in the US have English roots.  It's your sovereign nation and you should have a say in who you let in.
1/1	We survived before we went into the Common Market...we will survive after we leave the EU...all we need is the chance.
1/1	We the British people are very happy to be leaving the parasitic, EU(SSR) dictatorship,
1/1	We the people don’t want it saving we want full Eu membership cancelled as that’s what we voted for via David Cameron’s big Eu vote speech !! GET ON WITH IT
0/0	We think the best thing that could happen would be a revote on the Brexit... It's weakening the English economy.
1/1	We thrived for thousands of years and became a world power because the EU wasn't around to lead us by the nose.
1/1	We tried to get better agreements and more freedom before however we got given nothing.

1/1	We will now have true democracy once again. We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees. We will also be able to negotiate trade deals with the rest of the free world, without the stranglehold dictats of the EU beurocrats. Because the changes will be gradual, most people won't notice much difference for quite a while. But once the country finds it's new freedoms, I think we will see things change for the better.

1/-1	We work as a UK it will work
0/0	We would likely be at a considerable diplomatic disadvantage because the EU would inevitably look after its own interests and any terms offered would benefit the EU first.
1/1	We'll all be better off for it
0	We'll be the 51st state of the United States when Boris Johnson will shift job from Prime Minister to Governor or the British Isles, 85% of land designated for Trump's new golf developments, 5% for concentration camps, and thos lucky enough to be all camped up in Jaywick waving little union jack flags to the melifluous sounds of Farage

0/0	We're finished as a country unless we ignore the referendum result, that's the reality. I don't really care whether that defies democracy, the fact it we're better off in. Our elected MPs must act to keep us in. However if we actually do leave then I and many others will leave this country for good
0/0	We're heading into a new dark age and it may be way longer this time.
0/1	We're knackered either way, bend over for Europe or get shafted by our own government
1/1/1	We're leaving a political union not the blinking continent!! We are still European just not members of a bloated unelected self serving political union…
1/1	We're leaving, even if we have to bring back the noose for traitors. Wimp.

1/1	We're not leaving Europe, we are leaving the European Union
1/1	We're not out yet until the Prime Minister invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, why pay 20 billion pounds a year and get less then 10 billion back, the country is being dragged down in the gutter. Thank you for your coverage, hope we do a trade deal with the USA our true partners. Socialism is the new word for slavery.

1/0	We've been in the EEC/EU for over 40 years and haven't seen much in the way of EEC/EU grants up here in the Yorkshire coalfields.
1/1	We've done it, lads. We've escaped this lunacy. #GotBrexitDone
0/-1	We've done what Hitler, the Kaiser, Stalin and Napoleon couldn't do. Split the Country about an issue no one gave a monkeys about about for forty years. And all so that I can get up at 5:00 to pick fruit and vegetables.
0/0	We've got Irish (North & South) ancestry & my Sister was hoping we could apply for Irish citizenship (I doubt it), if the shambolic mess goes through.
1/1	We've got free trade deals with most of the world though? The UK has one of the freest economies in the world and that's down to government policy, not the EU.
0/-1	We've had 70 years of peace but look around there's lots of other things that are not peace so I hope you break that down in this video
0/0	We've had a year of "will of the people" "accept the result" "Get over it" "the people have spoken" - yes we have and we say no to Brexit
1/1	We've had one and we don't need another, get us out, it's simple but we have the wrong people in charge and the choice is poor.
0/-1	We've seen with Brexit and other things that there's a dark impulse to be petulant and frustrated with complicated solutions
1/1	We've voted and sposed to be leaving...are we, we still have to fight for freedom

1/1	Welcome to the UK from Europe and good bye to EU membership
0/0/0	Welcome to the United States of Great Britain. Enjoy your watered down employee protection laws, lower standards of food safety and, of course, a completely privatised health care system (or, at the very least, a health care system that has been portioned off to for-profit private companies with minimal oversight - much like those efficient privatised rail franchises). Greatest own-goal in modern history. Have fun with that.
0/0	Welcome to the dehumanisation of Britain
1/1	Welcome to the independence club EU is a globalist organization that seeks to destroy every ounce of national sovereignty and freedom it sees. It's downfall should be swift

1/0	Well Brexit basically just got cancelled. Hahaha
0/0	Well Brexiters keep harping back to WWII. They will enjoy the rationing of food etc. Gives them the Dunkirk spirit.
0/0	Well Done Boris Johnson.😡😡😡😡😡😡😤🤬 UK will suffer and regret this! Edit: Guys it’s my opinion🙄😲😲😲
1/1	Well Done Prime Minister Mr Boris Johnson, Nigel Fararge, The Brexitees, And The Unity Of The British People. A Victory For Real Democracy.
1/1	Well Done now The British flag can be flown and be proud of a great country
0/0	Well I hope all the brexiters will be happy, esp the old, i hope they like the cold and hunger.
0/0	Well I think it's a terrible idea, but...bring it on. I will take my skills abroad, live amongst a less insular culture for a while. When the impoverished UK is desperate for people to come back within 5-10 years, house prices would hopefully have come crashing down somewhere to near a level I can afford. If, not, I'll stay away. Win-win either way for me.
0/1	Well I was wrong. Can’t believe we rounded up all the foreigners and shot them, they’re having to print £500 notes and I starved to death yesterday like everyone else.
1/1	Well I'm not Russian and I'm a real person of this country! I would be happy to leave with no deal and take the risk.
0/0	Well I'm not from the UK, so my opinion doesn't matter. Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
0/0	Well IMO (I'm not British) , It's dumb to let 51% decide decades of country future, that's first of all. At least 3/4 of the country should agree with these kind of decisions. For seconds, mostly older generation voted to leave and younger wants to stay.. So it is not that elders are right or wrong, but in saying how the future is shaped I think the ones who should have more voice are the people who will be in that future let's say ~5-15 years from referendum. And a lot of campaign let's get out was - we will get all the benefits and 0 consequences, mayyybe slight discomfort, but nah, EU will fall before our feet.. And that was complete BS. But the people who know no better still believed that. So the second referendum is the way to go IMO - with all the facts everyone has now, the truth about negotiations, and what may or may not happen after Brexit is more clear, the people should have the last say - is that what they wanted, or the campaign leave was such a BS that it's better to stay than go through?
0/0/0	Well Johnson won’t be broke at the end of this, but I’m not so confident for the rest of us.
1/0	Well The UK voted out. Let's see how northen ireland and Scotland will will take that shall we. Also the Channel is not getting larger. So if british peoples want to leave Europe they need to learn how to make their island move... and start to row .
0/0	Well UK is setting up barriers to trade with the world. So basically its like gravity, you minimize trade you earn less money
0/0	Well a majority of the People now wish to #Remain in the EU...but in Parl ideologues & party hacks are denying the option to test it, being more interested in imposing their will on the Ppl than the true maj Will of the Ppl.
0/0	Well anywhere Britain wants to go dealing EU is there already so !
1/0	Well at least they have to ask for access to our fishing waters now instead of just taking it. And the answer is No! No! No!
0/0	Well at least we won't have to worry about straight bananas any more - we probably won't be able to buy bananas after December!

1/1	Well he's right I do support #Brexit
0/0	Well hey, on the bright side at least this shows that the US isn't the only country inhabited by far too many people with so much space between the ears they probably suffer weather patterns.
0/0	Well in fairness. I hope our political/economic turmoil acts as a lesson to the rest of the Europe. A lesson in what not to do.
0/0/0	Well it's an impressive act of shooting oneself into the own foot on an epic scale.
1/1	Well it's finally about time. The people of U.K. have been waiting for this for a long long time

0/0	Well my future is now officially fucked. Good job voters, not thinking about our generation. Good job.
0/0/-1	Well no, Dear Leader Hegemon. You are not the determinant or repository of the will of the people, still less their evidence-based opinions. In this case, since the people involved have been found ’not to be serious criminals’ and to have served any sentences due them, your proposed deportation plan represents your shameful misrepresentation of the facts. Don’t listen to this fool if you want to retain any personal integrity.
1/1	Well obviously German citizens don't consider the UK a part of Europe for a while now. When traveling last year I had a smartass Passport control agent laugh at me when I referred to England as Europe. So good riddance to the EU and more power to you, get on with it. You will enhance your strengths, and conttol your own destiny.
0/0	Well of course he is. #Brexiters are so high on their #Brexit cr*p they'd cheer a deranged clown if it insulted #EU... Oh look - they just did. When will they actually get back to looking after their voters (most of whom DO NOT NOW WANT BREXIT)???
0/-1	Well organized and funded by the globalists.
1/1	Well over 2 years of prevaricating and now they want to delay. Being booted out of office is not enough. There needs to be some sort of retribution, starting with imprisonment
1/1	Well said. All of Britain should realize their freedom is at stake. The mask is off of the beast. Tell the EU no. Tell them to go to hell. Live free or die!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Well since we 'have all the cards' as the brexiters kept telling us, I expect the EU to fold completely in the face or our overwhelming advantages and give us everything we want........right?
0/0	Well technically all old (65+) people voted leave which is so stupid they get to vote because they wont feel the consequences as much us younger people ALSO northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay but England voted to leave so If Brexit does happen Scotland and northern Ireland will make a vote to leave GB and Join E

0/0	Well, I can only agree with you Simon.Well, I can only agree with you. But maybe the better idea would have been to fight Brexit when it was still possible?
1/1	Well, I think it's safe to say that Europe is slowly dying.
1/1	Well, Switzerland have been doing quite well without the EU!
0/0	Well, a lot of people have now become a lot better informed and they realise Brexit is going to be extremely painful, both economically and socially, and they want it stopped!
0/0/1	Well, a recent study, presented to an economic conference in Manchester, demonstrated that every country joining the EU since 1972 was substantially better off by 2008 than they would otherwise have been, with the sole exception of Greece.
0/1	Well, after so much BS, I say Europe should also have a referendum on the UK staying in. You want out? Fine: get out. And stay out.
0/0	Well, for a start, I would guess that having a divided country is not a good opportunity to change the current system...
1/1	Well, here we are. Time to move on as a country and look at other issues
0/0	Well, hold on. It hasn't gone through yet, and won't for several years, and there's many a slip between cup and lip. Boris might get run over by a bus!!!!
1/1	Well, if europe and the euro are so fucking amazing you don't need to worry about anything now do you?! Kid
0/0	Well, it is crystal clear Brexit is impossible to execute, let's cancel the whole thing and get back to our lives.
0/0	Well, it's time to vote on the #EUref now remember the immortal words of Londo Mollari and DON'T GIVE AWAY THE HOMEWORLD #VoteRemain
0/0	Well, just leave then! Who needs your arrogant, backwards-minded, soon-to-be-broke asses anyway? But don't expect any special treatment, once you're out!
0/0	Well, me and my partner who is English have moved to Germany now, so do what you want. We don't have to wait months to see a doctor for 5 minutes and aren't under threat from heroin addicts in the street anymore, despite open borders and 1 million refugees.
1/1	Well, personally, I am delighted that I can have a possibility of handing a sovereign state over to my children as is their birthright
1/1	Well, well, well......?????? Hahahahaha - what will the remoaners say now!!!?????
1/-1	Well, yes, the UK if inally OUT, but what next? the EU was a disaster waiting to unravel since it was conceived - it will be a faint memory in 5 more years.
0/0	Well... I am from Croatia and this brings tears to my eyes... Very sad day
1/1	Well........ May might not get what she wants! But carry on and us leavers will get the WTO deal that WE want!!
0/0	Well: ten months later, and Brexit has turned into a bumbling mess. Here's hoping Britain will be able to hold another referendum and stop the incoming hard exit on March 28th.

1/-1	Westminster waking up outside the EU, but with no sign #Brexit will be done anytime soon.
0/0	We’ll need a VISA to go to Europe. Driving licenses won’t be valid. End of the roaming charges for using our phone’s abroad. All of this means that Brexit is impacting on the lives of people. it’s just becoming on huge, gigantic mess.
1/1	We’ll never rejoin after all the benefits of Brexit are realised, the EU is hanging on by its fingernails anyway and difficult to see it surviving for many more years - it needs total reform but the people with the power to allow that are unelected and too deeply ingrained in the corruption!
0/0/0/0	We’ll see what a sort of “ Fantastic , Robust Economy “ UK hides in his pocket !
0/0	We’re alienating all of our closest trading partners, which is an extremely poor economic decision. The creation of a hard border in Northern Ireland could cause a resurgence of violence, but at the same time internal borders within the country are a bad idea as it would likely lead to the break up of the union, and if you have noticed how much of a shitshow Brexit has been for our economy so far imagine what Scotland leaving the UK would be like. Not to mention how shit this will be for businesses in Gibraltar. Free trade is a beneficial thing for everyone economically. I might decide I want to live and work abroad later in life, brexit would make this difficult. Skilled workers from the EU are very helpful to the economy and the NHS. The UK can no longer be a base for companies wishing to access European markets easily, which could cause them to relocate causing unemployment. The EU has an incentive to make this a disastrous decision for the UK to set an example to other member states considering leaving. In order to keep business we may have to ditch the higher European standards and accept lower standards of products from places like the USA, which could be bad for the health and quality of life of the general population as well as the environment. Also the Trump has said that the NHS would be on the table for a trade deal, which if agreed to by our politicians, who aren’t very well trusted at the moment could lead to the devaluation of healthcare as a basic human right. But hey at least we get blue passports.
0/0	We’re fucked here in the UK.
1/1	We’re leaving!!! Yes!!!! Bottle of champagne on 31/01

0/0	We’re stronger together though
0/-1	We’re unwrapping the twelve lies of Brexit
1/1	We’ve been here before with various German leaders threatening our Country . Ms Merkel thinks ‘Britain will need to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight’. Love her, hate her, or hate her some more, I despise this woman. These comments come from a Chancellor who single handedly, without so much as a care for any of the peoples, or Governments, of Europe, gave the green light back in 2015 for millions, yes, millions of migrants to swarm across Europe, unchecked, uncontrolled and unwanted, a situation which continues to this very day.
1/1	We’ve escaped the asylum, I can’t tell you how good it feels. Straight jackets off, face masks off, we can breathe again
0/0	We’ve had years of freedom of movement to do just that, but Brexit will change those opportunities.
1/1	We’ve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn’t know
1/1/1	We’ve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn’t know. People wanted to take back control.

0/0	What I find especially amazing is how many in the UK don't seem to care, or don't think it'll matter. There seems to be this widespread notion that "it'll all be ok in the end". As if the adults are going to come back into the room and sort things out. As if the rest of the world will set up some kind of safety net to bail the country out from the consequences of its own actions.

0/-1/0	What I find stupid is that I'm only 14 and this will probably affect my generation the most and some dying old sock is deciding our lifestyles. So much for 'Democratic'.

1/1	What I voted for 43 years ago and 2.5 years ago to GET OUT!!
1/1	What I would like to know is where is the Billions if not Trillions of pounds going to come from if we stay in the EU, we will need lots more Hospitals, Schools, and houses to cope with the millions of immigrants that are hell bent on coming to Britain plus the money for Doctors , Nurses and Teachers and billions of pounds per week for there Benefits, it is a lose, lose situation for the British People so VOTE TO LEAVE>

0/0	What a daft announcement. Sure, I’m a remainer, I hate the idea of brexit and think it’s going to throw our economy back 50 years, but I’m quite relaxed about actual brexit day and I’m sure most of my kind are as well. Nobody s going to riot about brexit, at least nobody on the remain side. But what we all should be wary about is what comes after that as the pain starts to set in and brexit voters realise that they have been had by brexiteers lies. That’s when the 5hit will hit the fan not on brexit day.
1/1	What a despicable woman. We voted OUT DO NOT GO AGAINST WHAT WE VOTED FOR
0/0	What a disaster, no winners here now.
0/0	What a disgrace. Leaving the EU for incredibly futile reasons that wont' be fixed anyways. This will be seen as the mistake of the century.

0/0	What a joke, there isn/t a good Brexit
1	What a lame headline. The UK did fine long before the corruption of the EU. They voted to leave and did. GLOBALIST news can stop the left media agenda anytime now.
1/1	What a load of absolute s***e!!!!! I have never once been asked to contribute to these new polls nor do I know anyone who has. I doubt anyone in the north of England (as per usual) has even been asked. WE ARE LEAVING FACT!! Why don't BBC put in the news the secret signing by the Queen herself. This cannot and will not be reversed. Get over it & tow the line tories and remoaners you've lost. FACT!
1/1	What a load of nonsense! The British voted to exit the EU. So exit! With NO DEAL. If the EU want to make that uncomfortable then UK knows who their friends are....good and strong reason to leave them in the firdt place

1/1	What a load of rubbish "the peoples vote" whatever that means, The People Voted and if your democracy means anything at all , Respect them
0/0	What a load of shoemakers. Poor people who voted leave had been convinced by lying scumbags like Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson that leaving would make them better off.
1/1	What a load of windbags we had a vote it was leave if we have to vote again we will have to vote every year then when it was never right for these remainers
1/1	What a misleading video. Free trade doesn't require political integration; the video makes it look as if the UK is cutting off all trade by leaving. Also, incredibly, left out was the refugee crisis, as if the only migrants coming to the UK were European immigrants looking for work. Shame on Vox
1/1/1	What a rubbish documentary. Eveyone is anti-brexit? Hardly balanced!

0/0	What a shame. We as Brits should be embarrassed…
0/0	What a shower of shit out politicians are. These are crazy times; I wouldn't hold my breath for any sort of inquiry into this mess anytime soon.
1/1	What a strange sense of cowardice that comes across from most of the commenters on here. Instead of embracing their new sense of self determination they whine like little children being forced to leave their house for the first time, full of fear and self doubt. The EU is a corrupt monster. I don’t know how any country puts up with it. Time to grow a pair and head off into the world. Independence comes with risk, but also great freedom.
0/0	What a terrible situation.
0/0/0	What a total embarrassment! Not in my name and not in Scotland's name! Showing a total lack of respect and behaving in a very infantile manner. This is cringe worthy.
1/1	What a trooper you are Nigel.Thankyou.
0/0	What a waste of UK time money and energy Brexit is
0/0/0	What a waste to get rid of all the benefits of the EU.
1/1	What about UK's share of EU community property? We must have paid a huge chunk towards those shiny new EU buildings we keep seeing in EU news reports.
0/0	What about a referendum of rejoining the EU? it will save the democracy and also can save the UK. The referendum was not about never join the EU again. Leave then rejoin one day after. IMO: Referendum of join the EU. if its fall then leave with withdraw agreement. It its not fall, then start renegotiate with the current agreements between the EU and UK. It then would be a one day technical Brexit(or even one week) followed an empowered rejoin agreement from people by referendum.
1/1	What about all the children of Europe who can’t get work because of the single currency. Don’t we owe it to them to end the madness of the EU and it’s dysfunctional currency which is destroying Europe.
0/0	What about the 16..18 years old - they weren't allowed to vote, even though it'll affect them more than anyone
0/0	What about the gained opportunity? All your companies that benefit hugely from restrictions on other countries that UK pushed trought (as one of the strongest members of EU). What about all the inteligence that can study in UK and then helps the economy...

0/0	What an infinitely sad, painful and unnecessary goodbye to our British friends. Europe will miss you dearly, I will miss you dearly.
1/-1	What an unbiased read the guardian is.
1/1	What annoys me is how remainers try to pretend that leave had a lot of financial backing and support. Leave won because of UKIP boots on the ground and because the people wanted out. We also won because Cameron didn’t stay neutral and remain ran such a negative campaign. The British people will not react well to a Brexit Betryal.
0/0	What brexit rewards?

1/1/1	What could be better than a Europe full of individual and proud nations. The EU has effectively destroyed this.
0/0	What did Britain say to its trade partners? “See EU later.
1/1	What did anyone really expect? The EU is basically modeled on the Sicilian Mafia, the Commorah. Capo di tutti Capi is Merkel. They negotiate nothing, apart from other people¿s ruin. They have inherited the same arrogant swagger once initiated by an Austrian with a dodgy moustache and who also attempted to humiliate Britain.

0/0	What do we want? Stop Brexit.
0/-1	What do you expect, childish morons.
0/1	What do you mean why?! 45% of export of the UK goes to the EU now, that's a fact. Trading won't stop directly after the Brexit, but then the negotiations have to start. Leaving the EU the UK has nothing to offer except trade. UK would be at the mercy of the EU. If a deal is struck, chances are it's more beneficial to the EU then the UK. It's difficult to say what WILL happen after a Brexit, but the EU won't be happy with a member state leaving. Difficult to say if they're willing to act on that, but it's not like it's a 1 in a billion sort of chance, it's very real. The EU will try to do as much as they can to keep the UK in, but if you push them away, they won't easily come back. You want me to give you credible evidence before you go into a debate, how about you show me credible evidence that the UK will be able to strike a good trading deal with the EU after the Brexit. Except you can't, no one can. Only way to do that would be to strike a deal with the EU before the Brexit. I know one thing for sure, if the EU isn't interested, the UK is fucked. Best case scenario (but I don't know why the EU would do this) is for the EU to continue trading with the UK as it is now. Worst case, EU backs off completely, and the UK is left in a massive economic recession. Realistically they'll probably tank your economy, but then offer you a trading agreement that is better for the EU, which makes sense, since the UK would have no real bargaining powers left outside the EU. In the end it's very simple, you told the EU to fuck off, and then you have to come back to the table with nothing new to offer. I mean what sort of deal would you even want to strike? You'd want to recoup the (little) money the UK is spending now on the EU, and just get a trading deal. Why on earth would the EU agree on that? It's worse for the EU, better for the UK, but the UK has nothing to offer to the EU apart from trade. As a friend, and as a member of the EU, UK is a very good ally. But don't think that the UK is what makes the EU, or that the EU cannot live without the UK, then you're just delusional. The EU could live another day if they decided to stop all trading with the UK, the UK would ... not fair well. But hey, at least no more immigration, and you can decide on your own policies. So I advise you to look into the facts and not throw away the future of your country over something as trivial as immigration or sovereignty. I won't badmouth the Brexit, as a nation you can do whatever you want, but I urge you to consider the very real possibilities that can occur on economical levels. You're not taking a gamble on your favorite football team down in the pub, it's the future of your country you're gambling with.
0/0	What does it mean? it means 48% of the population must go ahead with something they don't want. This kind of Democracy is broken
0/0	What ever small merit there might be in leaving the EU has been wasted by short sighted, ill conceived, jingoistic pig headedness. We will be worse off and have less influence in the world.
0/0	What frustrates me about this referendum is whatever decision 75 yr old Brenda makes, young people will be left to deal with #VoteRemain
1/1	What gets seldom said is that this is actually the best thing that could happen to the EU. The UK never belonged there. It was thwarting, sabotaging and leading the EU the wrong way. No, the agent of transatlantic dominion has been removed. That's good.

0	What most voters still don't realize is that the brexit referendum was basically a choice between the U.K. being a powerful European Union member state or becoming the future 51st state of the United States of America. That is basically what it will come down to on the long term. The world has changed a lot because of globalization and the rise of the BRIC countries. Nostalgia for the British Empire and economic austerity over the last decade weighed heavy on the result of that referendum.

1/1	What part of - THE EU DOESNT CARE DONT THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND? Can’t you see that they see us as a low level democratic people over there. We are part of a democracy and we are taking orders from non elected bureaucrats - why - because of money, because of wealth because of the economy. What about FREEDOM? What did millions of our hero’s die for? That we should give our sovereignty and Freedom over to a bunch of unelected and unapologetic tyrants. I say we BREAK AWAY. Advance Britannia.
1/1	What part of exit did you not understand? EU is doomed anyway.
0/0	What pisses me off most about the politicians playing power games with Brexit as the football, is that it won’t be them who may struggle to pay the rent or decide between food or heating or have permanent anxiety that their job will be lost. They’re immune to it all. #FuckBrexit
1/1	What planet are those 382 remoaners on who blame LEAVERS for the Brexit division ? Are they going to blame the LibAntidems for the tories getting an 80 seat majority ? probably. The refusal to accept a democratic decision taken by the majority of the people of the UK caused the division and there was only ONE group who caused that and that was the antidemocratic REMOANERS.
1/1	What problem does the existence of the EU ( club corrupt ) provide a solution to?
0/0	What really stresses me out though is that the UK has really unrealistic expectations of what can be done in this one year
0/1	What strikes me most is that a high majority of younger people voted to remain. In other words, Britain's future is compromised by an old and retro-minded population touched by extreme nationalism and xenophobia. You have my sympathy.
0/-1	What the UK is going to get is a hard Brexit, steered through by a coterie of hard-right Tory free market ideologues making decisions without any reference to Parliament.
1/1	What the UK may have lost in trade with the EU, is more than compensated with what the UK will gain in renewed trade with the Commonwealth, SADC and BRICS. New Zealand and Australia already have trade delegations, investigating renewed trade relationships with the UK, whilst SADC would love to use British International financial expertise. The English speaking "world" is much larger, richer and much more powerful than the EU. The UK have the advantage of the English language. This is a very powerful tool.

1/1	What they don't seem to get is this. The country voted to leave. That means if we reach the end of March and there is No Deal then that's how we leave. What the press doesn't tell you is the sheer panic in the EU countries whose economies will nose dive. All because Juncker et al. believe we won't do it. How wrong they are.

1/1	Whatever we offer wont be good enough for EU.
1/1	Whatever you feel about immigration there is a huge negative sentiment mainly driven by cheap Eastern European labour. We need to apply a meritocratic skill based approach to immigration, stop having insanely counterproductive immigration laws because the back door is wide open and stop using cheap labour to fund our economic growth at the expense of our social cohesion.
0/-1	Whatever you think of Brexit, it was utterly petulant and disgraceful for BBC to refuse to cover the PM's speech last night.

1/1	What’s wrong with no deal? Australia does $100 billion a year in trade with the EU without a deal
0/0	When Boris and Gove say that 'we have taken back control', who do you think 'we' is? It's not us, the people. Not in a country governed by Tories elected by a minority of the electorate. Not in a country where the House of Lords, unelected, can over-ride the Commons. Where bishops - men in frocks with big hats - can vote down Commons decisions. At least the EU parliament is democratically elected. This is an awful day for the UK, and especially for England. The only glimmer of hope is for a reunified Ireland and independent Scotland going forward into the future in the EU leaving England and Wales lonely and on the outside with very few friends.

At least UKIP have a plan for what happens "after" Brexit. Gerard Batten has actually done a great job of turning the party around, despite the MSM totally boycotting him from air-time.

0/0	When leave voters are sick of Brexit and struggle to give a reason why they voted the way they did, I think it’s time to stop this madness.
1/0	When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.
1/1	When one looks at the damage caused to the UK economy by the EU we are well off out. Grants co Cadbury's owners to relocate a factory to Poland ,over fishing of our waters. Aid for Valeo and Twinings to establish operations in East Europe are reported in the FT

1/1	When such so called important figures in our political hierarchy are clearly working against the voters' interests surely they must be removed. I refer specifically to Hammond and Bercow whilst the PM herself is no enthusiast for leaving, she at least is not working deliberately against it. Bercow and Hammond are and must be removed surely.

1/-1	When the EU is doing well, Britain stays to make sure the Union does not progress more uniformly. When the EU begins to fall apart, i.e. it doesn't need Britain to tear it from within, Britain decides to leave
1/1	When the EU see that we are really leaving with a no-deal they will fold up like an old paper bag. And all those traitorous expats will lose their health cover and right of residence and have to sell their EU home at a big loss. Boo-hoo! Haha!
1/1	When the EU was called the common market with a membership of 6 nations back in the 1950s it was a pragmatic and even noble 'union' based on trade. This was post war, European countries were skint, populations depleted, Germany was rubble, France was in dire straits. A loose trade alliance was a good thing. Tragically by the early 60s it became a German/Franco carve-up which morphed into the democracy despising, nation destroying EU mutant we have now. Their goal: a superstate run by France/Germany via unelected, unaccountables with a pretend, sham Parliament to give the false impression of democracy to con the people of Europe. 10,000 EU officials earn more than the UK Prime minister. They have their own shopping maul. Chauffeur driven, 1st class flights and hotels, huge expenses all paid for by the people of Europe. Their goal is to rule Europe from Brussels. For 60+ years this agenda has been hidden, secret, now it's out in the open and cannot be allowed. It is Nato that has kept peace not the EU. Yet another EU lie/myth. History has shown what happens when a small group of 'elites' end up ruling over the many. It never ends well. People tend to suffer the consequences for decades until they cannot take anymore. Had Remain won - each month, each year ordinary peoples right would be erased, bogged down by endless oppressive rules and regulations. Democracy all but dead. A dark path. Thankfully the UK is about to leave. Eventually the EU will either sink into the abyss, split or change entirely. For 5 minutes back in the 1950s the EU had it right - a trade alliance of democratic nations. For the other 60+ years it has got it wrong. The UK has got it right.
1/1	When the European people wake up they will realise that the EU has evil intentions and will want to leave it as the UK did.
1/1	When the UK is finally free from the EU Extortionists, the UK can finally get down to business in growing the Economy, that will have monetary revenue now in UK Control that can now be used to uplift the Civil Service pay scale Sector.

1/1	When the UK leaves others will follow. The EU is dying.
0/1	When the UK voted to leave the EU, many feared a severe and immediate economic hit. The Bank of England suffered a loss of credibility for predicting a recession that never materialized (possibly because it’s own monetary policy actions stopped it). However, there has already been an economic cost to the vote.

0/0	When we get our final say/2nd referendum vote, and we will, the debate is going to be fascinating. Are the Leavers going to base their argument on the parcel of lies they fed to us during the 2016 Referendum? Given that every one has been clearly and firmly nailed you would be forgiven for thinking they would be utterly stupid to do so. But what is their alternative? New lies? But what would they be based on since they pretty much covered all the issues with the first lot. Going to be very interesting.

1/-1	Whether we cancel Brexit, or not, we have to decide what kind of relationship we want with the EU.
0/0	Which clearly shows how there are NO economic advantages to leaving the EU. Brexiters promised better trade deals than the ones the UK is currently part of would be negotiated and ready to sign by the time of your departure. That never happened. Brexit is a SCAM. The only real reason for it was a handful of billionaires’ TAX AVOIDANCE, and the only reason for millions of voters supporting was XENOPHOBIA.
0/0	While I agree that there are problems with mass migration, and British voters have the right to vote on a referendum, Cameron was an absolute dunce to even allow the vote. Brexit, while popular in some circles, will cause havoc in Europe.
0/0	While I agree with your sentiment that this is typical overreaction from the market, the real (negative) effects of the out campaign will creep in more slowly: a weaker Union, relative isolation from the economic power of the remainin EU, and the gradual realization by Out voters that their lives are not soon improving.
1/1/-1	While the UK suffers some of the largest interregional inequalities in the developed world, these might be exacerbated if, as some economists expect, the more prosperous parts of the country prove to be less affected by and/or more resilient to, any economic impacts of Brexit
1/1	Whilst we may be down a little in the short term, i believe the strategic advantage of being out of the EU, particularly in terms of agility, will pay off in the long run.
0/0	White people think that the immigrants are just gonna disappear into space now
1/1	Who CARES about the world economy. Each nation needs to worry about their own. GB's economy would be much better if they left the EU because then THEY could make their own decisions about the direction they need to go in trade and such. Not to mention, when you are paying for millions of people to come to your nation and live without working or doing anything that would better the nation and people, your economy will always be bad. Where does the money come from to pay for all of these "Refugees"? Lots of different organizations and programs but they all come down to the original spot, the taxpayers that work and pay taxes. Great Britain needs to bail on the EU before they themselves are eating up by it. Several nations in Europe are essentially gone, look at France, Germany, Brussels and others. GB isn't far behind and will meet the same fate if they don't rid themselves of the EU, close their borders tight and start kicking out "refugees" and other troublesome Muslims that have no intention of assimilating into GB but want to make it theirs with Sharia. In America we need to clamp down on our border, kick out ALL illegal immigrants, STOP bringing in Refugees and start sending some of them back. We are almost $20 TRILLION in debt thanks to Obama and the Liberal disease. We cannot afford to just give away more money to people that want to come here, not work, not assimilate into America, but essentially take it over with their culture and so called religion.
1/1	Who actually cares about Immigration?! I don't like the fact that laws can be passed in Brussels and we have to implement them without a say. They also take plans and suggestions from large companies and lable them as new EU legislations. Things like building new roads as it will make it easier and cheaper for companies and heavy industry to traid so the CEOs bribe the EU into doing meaning its funded by the tax payers. Its so corrupt.

1/1	Who cares what Boris does as long as he helps us get out of the bloody EU, one man's career pales into insignificance when compared to the vital issue of our place in Europe, make no mistake Europe is heading into the abyss, don't let it drag us there with it...vote out!
1/1	Who cares what the EU agree - we're out of here.
1/1	Who cares what the EU says about us? The important fact is that we were suitably intelligent to see that being a contributor (never legally a member per international law) was a pure waste of time, effort and money. Our leaving will in future come to bring benefits beyond our wildest dreams.

0/0/0	Why are #Brexit supporters still angry? They've "won" haven't they! Or maybe they've just always been angry and nothing will ever please them!
0/0	Why are UK citizens blaming the EU for their local austerities? That is muddle-headed. Expressing anger is fruitless unless it lands on the people with the power to do something about the problem. The EU doesn't tear down rotten buildings in a small town. The EU doesn't build playgrounds or see that the grass in parks is mowed. That isn't its function. People can control their government using intelligent activism, starting at the local level. If the people elected to power aren't doing the job, consider choosing another. Grousing is for releasing pent up anger and frustration but positive change needs method, committment and steady command of the facts. Local problems start with local solutions. Seek the change you desire from your community, your friends, your family and yourself. Organize, identify goals and then pursue the means together. Before leaving a trade agreement that delivered prosperity, citizens need to know explicitly what they will lose, what they will gain, and how they will mitigate the negatives when they occur. People have to do this on the mundane level every day, and it is called 'common sense' or 'being practical' or 'thinking things through'.

1/1/1	Why do they always consult pensioners or people with not much to say on Brexit. Interview me... I'm 34 and I have a lot to say about why we will be better off outside of the bloc.
0/0	Why do they even leave eu they lose money for no reason.
1/1	Why do they keep coming up with stupid comments. Farms in England could provide if allowed.. people can grow their own like they did years ago
1/1	Why do they never talk about the good parts about leaving the EU? I like how everything tried to push England into voting in, but we were like no, let's just see what happens if we leave.
1/1	Why do vox look at this as a bad thing ,being in the EU made Britain not a democracy anymore which we fought world war for ,we weren't deciding our own laws and if we wanted the right as a country to change a law we had to go to Brussels to earn back which cost millions while doing so .Also we're not against all immigrants ,we don't mind the educated working ones ,it's the ones that are here illegally receiving child benefits and so on which we shouldn't have to pay to them but the EU says we must until just a few months ago when we had to fight for the right to make this our own decision . So who in Britain benefits from the EU ? Well I'll give you a clue ,it's not the average middle class working majority of Britain but the mp's ,politicians and so on ,so if they have any say in this they will encourage people to stay as it benefits them . Learn your facts vox.
1/0	Why do we even bother to vote in this country?? I feel powerless and totally disillusioned now. Well, I guess it's just the way the worlds going; to shit.
1/-1	Why do we need any colour passport? We should just be able to shout, “British! Less of your nonsense!” and stroll straight through.
1/1	Why do we pay our mp's for years it seems they have done nothing,cannot make decisions.Hide behind the EU, They gave the electorate the decision about leaving.We decided.Once we leave we will then sort you lot out.
0/0	Why do we want Brexit at all if we simply end up in a more unfavourable position? We should revoke Article 50 whilst we can.
0/0	Why do you keep saying there are so many immigrants yet are overlooking fact that 2 million UK citizens moved to Spain since 1973?
1/1	Why do you need to governed by the French and Germans?  You are an Englishman.  Stand up.  Have some backbone.
1/1	Why do you think that they are making it so awkward for Britain to leave, they are panicking their best customers are going to buy elsewhere
0/1	Why does Britain like tea so much? Because tea leaves
0/-1	Why does the Prime Minister insist that "we have a deal, a great deal", when it is obvious that a trade deal is still under negotiation.
1/1	Why does the UK have to give up on self-rule to do business with the rest of Europe? The answer is, they don't. The United States doesn't have to submit to a European Court, a European Parliament or any other Euro bureaucratic monster. Free markets: Yes. Loss of self-rule: NO. It's quite simple really.
0/0	Why dont people understand that immigrants are a valuable work force? Lol
0/0	Why dont people understand that the uk isn't a big empire anymore
0/0	Why encourage the pointless and divisive ’battle’ between leavers and remainers, as if the referendum had not already happened ? As a ’remain’ voter I realise that we have to make the best of it now, and support as ’soft’ a brexit as possible. A ’People’s vote/final say’ would leave us open to the risk of a ’hard’ or ’no deal’ brexit and therefore makes no sense at all.
0/0	Why everyone is hailing this like some kind of good thing is beyond me because it’s nothing to be proud of at all. Just shows English people are fucking dumb cunts. I’m actually ashamed to be from England.
0/0/0	Why has it all gone so horribly wrong? Please tell us Boris.
1/1	Why has it taken so long ?
1/1	Why have a second vote when the first one has not been implemented? The referendum vote was to leave the EU, no mention on the ballot paper of a deal, or transition period, neither was there any mention of giving away our fishing waters or offering huge amounts of money for a deal. all these things are designed to lock us into the EU by the back door by a bad prime minister.
1/1	Why haven't we left yet
1/1	Why in the hell would any British citizen want to join the undemocratic union of the EU! The EU union is a joke. Britain stay as a Sovereignty State.
0/1/1	Why is Brexit going to be bad for the UK ?, when we will get a good deal outside the EU, German business have put pressure on there government to strike a good deal with us because there bank forecasts if they don't it will hit there Economy by some 6 billion euros a year, and they will have to up there contributions to the EU with an overall annual combined cost of 11 billion euros thus they are urging there government to ensure a good deal, and this is just one voice of many in Europe pushing there leaders to ensure a good deal for the UK.
0/-1	Why is England working so hard to keep Scotland?
0/0	Why is Theresa May so afraid of a new election and let the Briton vote again? After all, the Britons were lied with false pretenses leading to the voting of Brexit
1/1	Why is anyone annoyed by this? Patriots are standing up and unified as a country. Thatâ€™s a great thing. I love when I see that in the U.S.
1/-1	Why is control immigration such a bad thing?
1/1	Why is global supporting the EU instead of Britain? Cherry picking interviews? The people voted overwhelmingly to leave why skew the issue?
0/0	Why is leaving the EU seen as a must? Just because the vote won on leaving doesn’t mean the government has to leave especially since the vote were so close. In Sweden there has been multiple referendums where the public didn’t want something, but the government did it anyway.
1/1	Why is that guy spouting on about peace in Europe when he freely admits he doesn't know. What an idiot and there seems alot of remain people that have failed to educate themselves about what is really happening in Europe.
0/0	Why is the government not listening to the business people of this country & actually stopping this ridiculous thing called #Brexit.. it will go down in history as an embarrassment to this country.
1/1	Why is this a significance? If the U.S. left NATO they'd still have treaties... just not a special name. Why the hate against the brits, its their country F off.  love, Husky Hockey
0/0	Why is this happening? Because fools voted for a pathological liar and he now has 5 years to do whatever the hell he likes. Democracy assumes the people you vote for are honest. When they're not, democracy dies. #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
0/1	Why is this nonsense even being tolerated? We've known the EU wouldn't renegotiate for weeks. before the Brexit deal was defeated and before the pointless Brady amendment, and yet we're just sticking our fingers in our ears and carrying on as though we have never been told the bleedin' obvious. At this point, it is getting incredibly hard not to think the Government is just running down the clock to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.
1/-1	Why is vice president very upset? LOL

1/0	Why not let Nigel do the trade dealing with the EU, he has more experience and will not be fobbed off. Nigel has done more for our country then any Politician since Churchill, so why isn't he in our government.
1/1	Why not send the EU our annual welfare bill for the 5 million EU migrants that live here and knock that off the amount...?
1/-1/1	Why on earth should the British compromise with French fishermen when the French have built camps on their North coast to facilitate and encourage illegal immigrants travelling to the UK.
1/1	Why on earth would anyone want to prolong the agony. We had a people's vote. Just get on with it.
0/0/0/0	Why people want to build borders, can't we just be friends

0/0	Why should we risk the damage of a no deal Brexit for nothing but a flawed ideology?
1/1	Why shouldn’t the Uk undercut the EU, in trade deals and services. The Uk has left the EU, to steer its own course in business. Not make itself less attractive to investors.
0/0/0	Why so much hate against the EU?
1/1	Why spin this into purely an immigration issue - people this is about FREEDOM. Pure and simple
0/0	Why temporary dropping out of the ECHR and a no- deal brexit are all bollocks Johnson will have a very nasty collision

1/1	Why will anyone want to stay in the EU? - Do these people travel into Europe to see what is going on there?
0/1	Why will anyone want to stay in the EU? - Do these people travel into Europe to see what is going on there? The UK do not need a deal. The EU NEEDS the UK. It is the EU that needs to be trying to make a deal with the UK. The UK simply needs to leave and take back control of its own destiny.
1/-1	Why won't she just quit. She doesnt seen to understand that nobody wants her shoddy deal or her to remain as PM
1/1	Why would Britain stay in when the EU is becoming one giant federal system?

0/0	Why would anyone vote for Brexit?
1/1	Why would anyone want to join the EU? If the EU turned into a simple trade union, instead being a controlling government over sovereign governments, then it would be so much better. Until then, cheers to the UK from the US of A

0/0	Why would young people want to stay after a Hard Brexit or a Crash Out Brexit wrecks their prospects.
1/1	Why you make such a sweeping statement? Of course ‘leavers’ understand we’re close geographically (and economically) to Europe. Europe (in its widest interpretation) is not a stable and secure place. To be successful we need to be positive to all challenges, Brexit and others.
0/0	Why? Why do you want to leave? How does this benefit anyone?

0/0	With Brexit, London’s financial industry access to the EU market will have more regulations and obstacles, undermining the competitiveness of London’s financial services compared to EU financial services.
0	With Brexit, it's the same as separating life partners. Parents (EU and UK) go apart, and children (people) have to live with negative consequences. By separation everyone loses.
0/0/-1	With Brexit, some Brits have rewritten WWII history. They have forgotten about their allys to the east who sacrificed thousands of men on their way to Germany, liberating many death camps in between, before hoisting the Soviet flag above the Reichstag
1/1	With Her Majesty the Queen's Birthday upon us, and St. George's Day within three days away, stand up all of you who love that land of Hope and Glory as I do a total stranger from a land where hatred for you is instilled from cradle to grave and beyond. ( I don't mean Australia ) Britons throughout the Centuries have stood as tall, straight, and fearless, as a Guardsman does when he is fighting for you, that is what's needed now to stop the Quislings from surrendering to a dictatorship that knows no bounds but the ones that tie Nations up in rules, and restraints, denying you the freedom to be your own Land of Hope ,and Glory. Vote to regain your soul, and sovereignty, by denying those who do not live in, nor love your Nation any say in what it means to be British so leaving you to be a sovereign Nation once again. God Save The Queen.
0/0	With Osbornomics in full flow the shock of leaving the EU will send us into full recession, but as long as we get our "sovereignty" back it'll be worth it...
0/0	With all the information available and very clear arguments made against Brexit especially a'no deal' one and moving on to WTO rules along with the benefits of being in the EU and any sane person is left thinking of leave supporters as a mix of anarchist's, disillusioned or not very bright individuals.
1/1	With all the new calls for more referendums around EU, we can hold that this was indeed the topple of the first domino. May the EUSSR's fall be swift, and permanent.
0/0/0	With brexit UK could risk losing a wave of investment, and with it, a raft of new technologies.
0/0	With critical levels of homelessness, an NHS crisis and so many other problems which need urgent attention, can we really afford to be wasting so much time and money on a Brexit which we can all see is falling apart?

0/0	With my EU citizenship trashed, for all time ... my rights to live anywhere in 27 brilliant countries gone ... up in smoke. I am 66 ... And I say f*** to a system that gives Boris a majority of 88 MPs on the vote of 43.5% of those who voted. De Facto dictatorial power for 5 years. Not a single Tory MP who can represent my Remain point of view ... Boris got every single last candidate to swear to Brexit before being allowed to be a candidate. Idiotic and stupid are far too polite to describe the system we have. Why should anybody bother to vote when the 56.5% have 80 fewer seats than the 43.5%. And what happened to the report on Russian interference ... ? I am not proud to be British ... rather I am ashamed to be associated with this small minded selfish rather stupid bunch of people who tolerate such unfairness.
0/-1	With no deal,all goods will be checked anywhere in the world the second after Brexit
0/0	With no trade deals in place and no one really needing anything you have I would say that the future for you post a no deal brexit is bleak. All your industry seems to be leaving ahead of brexit. Barclays, a bank no less, have move 190 billion in assets out of England into Ireland. You are dooming yourself, and for no good reason. This is not a gloat, I am genuinely worried about your economy and the livelihood of my British friends and family.

1/1	With you all the way
1/1	With £39 Billion invested in to our own economy, instead of being frittered away to the Eu, its more likely that we will be rejoicing in the streets, £39Billion will end Austerity and will save the NHS, with plenty left over.
0/0	Withdrawing Article 50 *is* the only sane thing to do. After that is done, those who peddled the Brexit lies should be brought to trial. The damage they have done to the country - and will do if they are allowed to go any further with this madness - is almost incalculable.
0/0	Within 10 to 25 years, the United Kingdom will not exist as it does today. Northern Ireland, Scotland, and maybe Wales will secede from the United Kingdm and rejoin the EU.

0/1	Without the EU maybe there's an end to blaming the EU for everything. Maybe the people wake up and take a closer look at what their government is actually doing (or not doing).
0/0	Without the EU protecting us we will have less freedom, the extreme right wingers in British politics will see to that.

1/1	Wow, these lads finally did it. So Britain is out of EU for good?
1/1	Wow, what a completely one sided view of Leave voters. Come and ask me why I voted leave. Immigration was bottom of my list of reasons, I'm more concerned with unelected officials in the EU Commission being the only people who can propose legislation which affects all of us.

1/1	Wrong .They wont be forgiven for not having a proper Brexit.
1/1	Wrong again matey, the only reason the EU is sitting back and waiting is because they know the snowflake MPs we have will secure a deal for them.

0/0	Yeah I’m sorry, but a massive proportion of us don’t believe any of that. We see economic uncertainty, risky trade deals with the United States, Northern Ireland and Scotland leaving the union, and a generation impoverished of the opportunities of the rest of Europe.
1/1	Yeah own free will
0/0	Yeah sure... the Pound Sterling dropped 20%... racists are attacking immigrants now.... wonderful Great Britain !! Good luck !! You idiots !! .... Glad you're an island !!! Only thing we need to to is flood the tunnel ......
0/0	Yeah this will not go good for the UK, we all knew it, pity they are suffering in a similar way as the US under corruption within the government
1	Yeah well the majority voted leave years ago so it’s about time democracy kicked into action.
0/0	Yeah! Who needs money and jobs? We'll survive by gnawing on our stiff upper lips and drinking our own arrogance. If you want out, GET OUT. Maybe you should have done it before you had a kid, you fucking cockroach.
1/1	Yeah, Hard Brexit is the best way!
0/0	Yeah, but blue passports. #worthIt. I'm joking. Crying inside.
0/0	Yeah, but remember that the idiots who support Brexit will then blame the EU because they aren't getting all the benefits with none of the effort...stupid will always be stupid
0/0	Yeah, don't worry, nothing will happen because of Brexit. It's just all a big show. Right.
0/0	Yeah, it would be stupid for the UK to leave the EU...
0/-1	Yeah, it's starting to really hit some of them now. I'm British and legally live in the EU27 - there are quite a few Brexiters who also live in the EU27 who are now shitting themselves because they will now be treated as (gasp) illegal immigrants unless they start paying taxes and abiding by the law. There's another Brexiter faction who are still spouting crap like, 'They need us here' and 'Nothing will change for us' because English exceptionalism is their 'reality'.
0/0	Yeah, let’s go back to 1973, now who wants 3 day weeks, power cuts and 11.5% interest rates on their mortgage and bank rates of 8%.......don’t all rush to get some. Older people will remember this so voting to go back to it surprises me somewhat.
1/1	Yeahhhhh at last we’re out of the most corrupt institution going
1/1	Years of debates over nothing! People voted out and this politicians have no right to stop the democratic will of the people and must get on with the exit! ✌
1/-1/1	Yeay finally see Wales on the map yep we voted overwhelmingly voted out.
0/0	Yeh! The only good Brexit is No Brexit. End of.
0/0	Yep its horriffic (I'm a Brit in the UK). Once the reality kicks in (after we leave) its going to get much, much worse. But of course its undemocratic and treasonous to have that point of view.
1/1/1/1	Yep we don't need the EU and its corrupt un elected Twonks. I'm voting OUT!
1/1	Yep, Aussie here. Our useless pollies are negotiating new trade deals already. Anything to kick the Europhiles in the nuts.
1/1	Yep, a 'small' country.... albeit a first world economy with world wide reach, but a 'small' country. A country with close ties with a still huge Commonwealth, even today, But a 'small' country. And of course, the EU is going to ignore a market of 60million in a country that was a net PROVIDER of funds that the EU needed - even if it is just a 'small' country. Yep, the UK has a lot to fear in the big wide world as a mere 'small' country, even though it's wealth will be its own in future rather than a bottomless pit that the EU can milk ad lib. Bottom line - the UK will decide its own future, not the partisan negative perspective of those chained to the bureaucratic mess that the EU was always going to be from day one of the experiment.
0/0	Yep. That people see brexit as some prize in itself...it just boils my piss. They're not even being selfish and seeking to profit at others expense. Its just pure spite. They know others are suffering more so they enjoy it.
0/0	Yep. The EU is blamed for our own failings.
1/0	Yep. The only reason people would want their sovereignty back is racisim. For sure.
0	Yep. ‘Brexit good, foreign bad, do not question, only believe Daily Express.....
1/1	Yes Brexit.
1/0	Yes Britain voted to leave, and yes the EU seems to have lost the UK. Although the EU is a bit like Hotel California, you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.
0/0	Yes EU will survive and reform of course, but UK will be left behind.
0/0	Yes I accept new #leave reality but it shouldn’t mean that voices critical of #Brexit must stop completely. #democracy needs a functioning opposition. Trying to silence all opposition to #brexitdeal @BorisJohnson is no better than calling for a 1-party dictatorship @LibDems
1/0	Yes I agree the anti Brits have done everything and anything to stop us leaving
1/1	Yes I agree, Brexit is terrible. I don't want to live in a free, independent democracy, it's far too difficult. I'm confused, insecure and unhappy. I wish I had some unelected bloke from Belgium or Luxembourg to tell me what to do . . . .
0/0	Yes I am very European, always have been always will be
1/1	Yes I stand, no regrets.
0/0	Yes I think Britain benefits a lot, financially, from being in the EU. I don't think there is anyone who thinks Brexit will make Britain richer.
0/0	Yes and 27 prime ministers will kneel and give everything so they can support UK, wake up man
0/0	Yes because cutting ourselves from Europe magically opens up new avenues for trade that weren't already there. /sarcasm Tell me, what opportunities are these? That way I can take credit when I suggest them myself.
0/0	Yes but it won't be the UK, it will just be England. Wales and Northern Ireland can secede too, as can Yorkshire, Isle of Man, Channel Islands. It won't be the 5th largest economy if it starts breaking up will it? It will get relegated down quite quickly and our huge debt mountain will quite quickly become unsustainable.too. So we may be independent and stop all the immigrants coming but we'll have kicked our economy in the goolies.
0/0/0	Yes but think of all the advantages of Brexit!!.. ahem ...er what are they actually?
0/0	Yes free from any hope of economic growth and prosperity. VOTE IN
1/0	Yes get out as soon as possible, we were once a great country, not anymore
0/0	Yes it has pointed out how stupid Brexit is to everyone, thanks Britain
1/1	Yes lets Get Brexit Done ASAP! Parliament Democracy vs the People Democracy, where Parliament democracy Use the excuse stopping No Deal, where its NO Brexit & delaying a GE vs the PEOPLE, that want the Ref, implemented.
1/-1	Yes mate, we are with you..No handing over our armed forces to the EU though?
1/1	Yes there is a bit of uncertainty in leaving, but what is certain is if we stay in this country is finished, my grand children would be in constant threat from the increase of imigration
0/0/0	Yes we could leave but how much better would it be if our politians both national and European worked a lot harder to promote a vision for Europe rather being constrained the dismally shallow views of the economists. Europe should be so much greater than the sum of its parts. It’s a shame that some of its parts are heading towards nationalism and irrelevance.
1/1	Yes we need to get out we will save billions that can be spent here
1/1	Yes yes yes at last. The EU want our money and they want to shaft us at the same time and make it as awkward as possible. Time to tell them that no deal equals no money. This should have been our stance from the start!
1/1	Yes yes yes. We are not in the EU. Why do we pay more for car insurance holiday insurance. Road tolls. What could we buy for 55milllion a day. We have immigrants in our street in new houses never worked taxi every where and a new car. And loads of ASB. They never came to work they came for the quote (soft ENGLISH).
1/1/1	Yes! I'm very excited to take out country back! How any of you remainers are happy to be controlled by Germany is beyond me. You have short memories and seem to have forgotten what Germany's aggression did to our country over 2 world wars and the amount of death and suffering they caused. Even though Germany lost two world wars, they have somehow managed to take control of Europe anyway! It's just that they've done it in a smarter and more civilised way in 2020 than in 1914 and and 1939. Germany have been the ones pushing for a huge divorce bill, yet everyone seems to forget the billions that Germany still owe us in war reparations, that they will never pay back! Yet we owe them money?? My grandfathers both fought in ww2 for my freedom, and I'm over the moon that today is the day that their suffering and sacrifice is no longer in vain! Today is a good day!
1/1	Yes! The country has done what it wanted and has left the 4th reich
1/1	Yes! you can go it alone. You are one of the greatest countries on the planet.
1/1	Yes!!!! We can finally push though all those rules that nobody can name now!
1/1	Yes!!!!!!! They finally had the brains and balls to do it! Goodbye EU....Socialist governments
1/-1	Yes, EU migrants have much easier life than non EU in entering the UK and this is not fair. There are two ways to fix the fairness issue though, why do we only consider one?
0/1	Yes, Scotland has taken your place at the grown ups table.
1	Yes, and what relevance does that have with us leaving a fascist super state? #brexit
1/1	Yes, britan should leave the E,U. Can’t afford to stay in with all this immigration and become a closed country
0/0	Yes, but nobody said that you can't. What you can't do is to negotiate as a big block with others, when you are not part of that block
1/1	Yes, everything is ok. Liam Fox says no-deal brexit is survivable
1/1	Yes, how will we ever recover from the best thing that's happened to the country in over 30 years?
0/0	Yes, it'll be the greatest act of unforced national self-harm, in modern history.
0/0	Yes, it's how I feel too, but we must put our energies into fighting brexit in every way we can!
0/0/0	Yes, let's revoke A50 and forget this stupid idea called Brexit for ever.
1/0	Yes, let's tell the stupid people that they voted wrong, says the elite and make a movie. Who has sponsored this crap? Yes, EU.
0/-1	Yes, look at all the other countries lining up to hand in their resignations... oh wait, there aren't any, because they're not dumb or arrogant enough to believe they can punch above their weight on their own.
0/0	Yes, that's what we teach our children. Still, this decision was allegedly made by "adults". It will be up to the children to fix the mess their parents made through their lack of maturity.
0/0	Yes, the EU must be quaking with fear with the UK saying give us what we want or we'll shoot ourselves in the head.
0/0	Yes, this article goes a long way to explain what happened in 2016. I live in an area of north west England which voted Remain as we’ve benefitted enormously from EU investment.
0/0	Yes, we do indeed buy produce from countries with whom we do not have trade deals. But wait until the pound takes a further hammering, and our EU sourced food becomes more expensive. Prices will rise and standards will fall. And if we waiver import tariffs, it will decimate British agriculture.
0	Yes, we lost the 2016 vote, but we're not getting over it; the result was both flawed & wrong, so we fight on to #StopBrexit
1/1	Yes, we should go the way of big business and heavy bureaucracy and remain in Europe so that we lose more and more power until German bureaucrats decides all for us! But wait... neither Norway nor Switzerland are EU members yet they have free borders and allow people of Europe to work freely. How does that work and why can't Britain have that too?
0/-1	Yes, we're all really, really happy about it. Just an incredible deal.
0	Yes, yes, you are not suggesting a u-turn because you belatedly realise Brexit was the stupidest idea in human history. It’s to sabotage the EU [wink] [wink]
0/0	Yes, you don't like Immigrants and students from other countries. That is OK, to be a isolated and uncooperative empire.
1/1	Yes,good for the UK. No more being told what to do by bureaucrats
0/0	Yes. I'm disgusted by the whole thing. I genuinely can't believe we are here, in this shit situation, waiting for the shit to hit the fan. You know what? Part of me really hopes it's as bad as I expect it will be, just to sicken the fucking bastards who voted for it.
0/1	Yes. You want out, so get out.
0/0	Yes. You're right. To see the world move away from globalisation, from progress, really would be amazing. . . amazingly stupid. Your entire desire for this is 'wah wah in my opinion the evil leftist liberals ALWAYS WIN waaaaah.' You don't actually give a fuck about England or understand it at all. The 'England' (you've never even visited, really?) that you love exists because of the EU, not in spite of. Sure, the history is cool, the land is beautiful, but a country is only as great as its people, and England's people come from all over. The English people believe in a socialist democracy, in sharing resources and giving newcomers a helping hand, knowing that those newcomers' children and children's children will be the doctors and lawyers and friends of your children and your children's children. You are a selfish, single-minded person who wants a personal victory and doesn't give a shit about the state of the U.K., and England, whatever you happen to think England is.
1/1	Yesss I want the lefties to be kicking and screaming
0/0	Yest it's Racist. Stop Brexit
0/-1	Yesterday Europe regarded us as a nation with influence - today they see us as a tribe with a flag.
0/0/1	Yesterday was BrexitDay. I sobbed like a baby.
0/0	Yesterday was my first vote: I voted to remain in the EU. I felt strongly that the EU was something which we needed to be. For me it wasn’t about politics. It was not about whether we’re Labour or Conservative, or right or left, it was about what we stand for. As a nation, could we really stand for abandoning an organisation which, although admittedly flawed, brings together so many nations in a common purpose? I hoped not. For me a vote for Europe was a vote for humanity and a vote for possibility and therefore this morning my first reaction was one of devastation. After far too many tears and a lot of anger directed towards the older generations and the politicians who failed to make this referendum moral and true, I want to make sure that my first vote, my first taste of democracy, leads to something positive. My first vote is going to lead to even stronger political engagement. It’s so important that despite this result we pull together to show the world that we are not hostile or prejudiced towards them. We have to be open to the future, and work to create a positive future. We are the future and although today our country has chosen to disregard our opinions, from now on we have to work even harder to make our voices heard. Today is the start of a new future, of a different future. Let’s not decide that everything is doomed. Instead, let’s work for a positive and accepting future of possibility, rather than the hostility that has been shown today. I know that the result of this referendum could have a huge impact on my future. I’m hoping to study German at university, but I also recognise that we can’t be too negative about today. Nothing can come from deciding that everything is damned, we’ve got to rise from the ashes and show the world our capability for love and good.
1/1	Yet again Britain fighting for freedom from Germany and their empire building, same old same old, we'll be liberating France and Europe again before long
0/0	Yet brexshitters still bray the EU is corrupt!!!!!
0/0	Yet she didn't mention 2 million brits working in EU.
1/1	Yet, somehow, Switzerland has all the trading benefits and none of the negatives.
1/1	Yeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Britain. Australia wants a Trade deal over a few beers. Congratulations on getting your freedom from the 4th Reich. Sink the EU.
1/1	Yipee we're out.
0/0	Yippie! Let's embrace poverty, high American health insurance and expensive medication. How a once great nation is going to the dogs.
1/1	You (EU) will certainly loose again.
1/1	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU
1/1	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU.
1/1	You Europeans really have to stop this the UK is breaking up rubbish, far from it didn’t you hear the DUP speech. Also we have a 61% deficit with the EU also the EU will lose it’s biggest military asset .
1/1	You Remainers need to realise one thing, we are leaders not followers, the following liberal snowflakes have had their day, it’s time to move aside & let the real patriots take control.
1/1	You Scots reading this, if there is no democracy, there is no INDEPENDENCE. The EU does not Do either.
1/1	You act like Britain is in a begging position when it comes to brexit when in fact it is the complete opposite seeing how Britain is Europe's fastest growing economy and is the top destination for many of Europe's manufactured products.
0/0	You always know when it's all going wrong. The PM decides to keep a low profile. He avoids scrutiny. He suppresses the truth. With #BorisJohnson, this has been the case since day one. But, it's getting worse, much worse. He's losing it. Downhill from here!
0/0	You and the Tory party have broken the country in two, divided families, risked the break up of the UK and degraded our economy. You will never be forgiven. History will label you as a ambitious fool completely out of your depth.
0/-1	You and your friends and family, including any children, personally, can travel, live, study, work or retire anywhere.
0/0/0	You and your govt are a spent force. There is a miasma of lies & half-truths, obfuscation & deflection, & an unconvincing manner, hanging over parliament these days. You put it there.
1	You are deluded. Corbyn lost. May remained the leader by however small a margin. Fact are facts :TU:
0/0	You are going to have more immigration either way. What's more, the immigration from EU almost negative at this point. Even Polish people are going home, since they can get better jobs with higher wages in Poland than in UK... This whole thing with immigartion is asinine, it really is. EU doesn't cause your immigration problem and if anything, it could be part of solution (for whole europe)
1/1	You are ignorant of the facts. Brexit is about a struggle for democracy. It's a resounding refusal to accept unelected undemocratic rule from a group of self-serving politicians who took office via backroom deals. Brexiteers couldn't be more un-Trump like.
1/-1	You are incredibly naive if you believe in unification and should study haplogroups.
0/0	You are now born a prisoner on the island... but what was your crime ?
1/1	You are right Europe just doesn't understand us and never has. We're a global nation not a European one. If we have to choose between Europe and the Atlantic we'll choose the Atlantic every time! 🇬🇧
0/0	You are spot on. Why cannot others see this fact. BREXIT will be disastrous. There is no going back to the good old days when England was a Great Nation, no matter what all the leavers think, wish, dream etc. England is not a major world power or player. Good luck on trying to stand alone.
1/0	You are welcome back when the boomers and the other fools are gone. Stay strong Britain
1/0	You assume of course the commonwealth countries want a strong union with the UK.
0/-1	You blamed the EU for misspending like this, paid for by austerity. It was always the Tories...
0/0	You brexsitters deserve for chlorine gas even for that what you did your children.
0/0	You brextremists shame my country.
1/1	You can blame the Remoaners for this one. Their fault parliament was preoccupied with Brexit three years after we should have left.
0/-1	You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!
0/0	You can do all of that inside Europe, you just don't want to and are holding the country to ransom. For that, you will either be a footnote in history or never forgiven.
1/0	You can embrace to your hearts content BUT I will never embrace lies corruption and your governments wish to commit
1/1/1	You can fish somewhere else Mr Commission er but in the UK waters or tell your fellow countrymen to change there diet
1/1	You can have extra time to do the paperwork on an agreed, and passed, deal - but you may not delay the actual decision to leave the EU, deal or no deal...
0/0	You can invest in schools and the NHS better by not doing Brexit and you know it
0/0	You can join Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Galloway, Boris, IDS etc. in their celebrations. Divided we fall.
0/-1	You can keep saying it buddy. But the answer is no.
0/0	You can quit EU but if you don’t solved your own problem it’s only fiction
0/-1	You can see a bit of sadness on his face. He certainly voted to remain
1/1	You can see these bitter old Remainers hate the UK ,wetting themselves to see the UK fail ,The Remainer slaves can always jump ship to their EU Masters
1/1	You can want a better Britain without being racist. Just because you feel that local builders being undercut by Polish ones coming in and sending money back to Poland rather than spending it on the local economy, doesnt mean you wouldnt welcome Polish doctors, nurses, teachers or whatever the country needs. As someone who married a non EU national, I found out first hand how governments were trying to look tough on immigration whilst hundreds of thousands of Europeans came in with no comeback. People didnt want it, it was foisted on them, and politicians didnt want to / couldnt say that there was nothing they can do, but there wasnt. Certainly as the price rose, and the hoops increased, it became obvious they were trying to do something, but they couldnt do anything effective. The problem is the EU and the politicians within it. Hopefully other countries will get their referendum now, but seems unlikely, until the next round of elections, when parties who promise elections will be elected.
0/0	You can wave your little flags around while the rich plan to pick your pockets.
1/1/1	You can't agree on "how" to leave EU so my suggestion is just ignore the EU and eventually they'll disappear. They have no power unless you give it to them, you know, like the devil.
0/1	You can't eat your cake and have it. BREXIT is Exit.
1/1	You can't put a price on sovereignty.
0/0	You cannot "make a success" of Brexit. It was and is a completely doomed suicide run predicated on "there’s too many brown people in my neighbourhood".
0/0	You cant say that the UK pays money to the EU without mentioning this, if you remove the money spend, you also have to add the money earned
0/0	You can’t insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore
1/0	You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. "Research the facts" - did you get yours from the Daily Mail? If you think that the majority of world-leading economists and business leaders who have been at the forefront of their respective field for years and agree that we will be poorer outside the EU are wrong and you with your one hour of research are right you are completely deluded and clearly extremely egoistic.
1/1/1/1/1	You could have drowned in the pools created by all the melted snowflakes in Britain on 24th June 2016. Long Live Freedom!
0/1/-1	You could have invested in the NHS and schools anytime you wanted, and you cut police numbers,
1/1	You did it Nigel. Congrats
0/0	You don't get even close to the same rights as other EU citizens unfortunately. Reminder that the leave campaign repeatedly. And explicitly promised that nobody would lose a single right from brexit.
1/1	You don't have to be a member of the EU to trade with it
0/0	You done goofed up Britain
0/0	You don’t fool anyone @BorisJohnson sounding all reasonable when you’re running down the clock to a #NoDeal disastrous #Brexit
0/1	You don’t need a piece of paper with numbers on it to have an economic assessment
1/0	You don’t need to be an EU member.. just look at Norway Iceland and Switzerland =)
0/0	You forgot the latest #BrexitBonus, UK job seekers not considered for jobs in some industries without an EU passport
0/0	You guys (UK) should head west or the Atlantic you are not Europe! Also you Scotland probably can’t be independent you probably won’t be able to join the eu and you’ll struggle ALOT to find good trade deals leaving you in some money problems. If your Scottish or from the UK no offence
1/1	You guys do you. I think because it passed in a vote, the will of the people should not be ignored, whether it's a wise decision or not.
0/0	You guys seem to be forgetting or deliberately ignoring the level of EU spending in the UK. It's not just about money though, it's about mutual co-operation and being part of a bloc that's big enough and strong enough to positively influence World events. Maybe you think England , Wales & NI can do that alone ? ( make no mistake , leaving the EU will lead to Scotland leaving the UK) . We could and should lead Europe and that way we shape things. The grass just isn't greener out of the EU!
1/1	You have NO idea of the anger revoking Article 50 would cause. Just get on with #Brexit.... which is what we voted for👍
1/1	You have a ton of support from across the pond. We can’t wait to get rid of our Democratic Party here. Keep the faith!
1/1	You have my vote Boris but if you win a majority and get Brexit done, please take a little advice from one of your voters - stay connected with the People - as you have done throughout your tour of the country during your campaign. Don’t become disconnected in London from them.
1/1	You have not idea what poverty is. UK have it really good, even with no deal UK will still OK. you panic but reality is money talks. everything will be chaotic for few months but the dust will set and we will be fine try to support British products and employ British citizen this will help your own house.
0/0	You have to admit, this Brexit thing is turning out pretty crap. It's nothing like you imagined is it? And there aren't really any EU laws that you don't like and those laws were made with UK input for the past 40 years anyway....unlike WTO rules. I mean, you don't really want hormone saturated beef or things like regulations removed so that unscrupulous traders can cut up baby formula with sawdust and stuff like that anyway.
1/1	You have your own waters, EU. Keep out if ours. The free lunch is over, messieurs. Come back only if you want your nets cut.
1/1	You join the EU and you loose control over your own country.
0	You just gave Johnson a massive majority to be as corrupt and incompetent as possible.
0	You know everyone who voted for brexit is that one kid who’s dad worked at a chippy
0/0	You know that with no deal,we'd lose ALL trade agreements we have with any country
0/1	You know things are bad when you move past anger to grief and you can feel despair knocking at the door!! If England will not reject this deal and go for a hard exit I just don’t know if England will survive.
0/-1	You know this is nonsense. Clearly you think your #brexit supporters are #thick
1/1	You know what Britain thinks, we told you on the 23rd June 2016, and seemingly repeat it every day, and every time you push the idea of not bothering after all. We want OUT. Out means Out, not if's no buts, no cherries, no deals, just out.
0/0	You know what the worst thing is... a LOT of people who voted leave changed their mind after the results were in, they claim they didn't realise that it would be so close and that their vote would count!
1/1	You know what... We were in two world wars... at the end of each one life was grim, housing shortages, food shortages, poverty, unemployment. But..... the people of Great Britain pulled TOGETHER and got through it and life got infinitely better. So then people, aren't we supposed to learn from history? History tells us pull TOGETHER and all will come out ok. Valuable lesson! Put your differences aside, stop behaving like squabbling children and support each other and your country. And may I suggest that if you don't want to do that there's still the option to move to the great EU that you're so fond of
1/1	You know. There were a couple good reasons not to leave that you made, but the rest of this video was bizarrely off-point. Are you telling me that the citizens of the UK shouldn't consider what they want in this vote, that they should only listen to what the USA, China, and other nations tell them to do? And of course the EU would be against the UK leaving the EU, because the UK is one of the only two economically strong member nations it has, the other being Germany. Let's also ignore that you're suggesting that 190 million pounds (10 BILLION per year) is somehow a negligible amount of money to pay to nations that can't support themselves, because it's not the 350 that the man quotes! You said a lot of bullshit in this video, a lot more than usual, and it's sad to see you gloss over it all as unimportant, whenever you would absolutely harp on these points if it were an opponent of yours making them.
1/0	You left dont expect anything for eu lmfo
0/0	You lost the Brexit campaign as this will be lost.
1	You lot moan about the state of Britain, when it's been ruled for 40 years by the corrupt EU! Moron.
1/1	You may think it's better when we work closer together. Personally I am fed up of Britains citizens constantly being dumped on or have to pay for every mistake our "Europe" partners make. Sick of bailing other people out. We must leave, vote out on 23rd June!!!!
1/1	You mean how the EU lost Britain..well done to the 17.4 million Brits who voted out and who believe in self determination, self governance, independence and democracy..Hopefully it will be the beginning of the end of this failed European Union that has done so much damage to Europe..God bless Great Britain from the George Cross island of Malta
0/-1	You mean the EU. U.k will always be part of Europe. All those years the gov told us not to trust Communism. Now that's what they want.
1/1	You must despise democracy we already had one and we voted to leave EU dictatorship
0/0	You must surely have noticed during the election they were careful to never say Brexit would be a success (as it would come back to haunt them) - they say it has to be done whatever happens because 'sovereignty')
0/0	You obviously have a national death wish. All Brexit options will be bad for the UK. No Deal Brexit will be a national catastrophe.
1/1	You obviously underestimate the resolve of the people of Great Britain and especially, their spirit.
0/0	You old fools. The rich will now gewt even richer. Exit will not solve your propblems.
1/1	You opened our eyes Nigel - thank you for all the years you have put in to show us how bad the EU is. Job well done.
0/0	You overlook the point that a successful Brexit was never possible and this should have been explained before the referendum.
1/1	You people really act like countries don't exist outside the EU. Hahahaha, fear here, fear there.... Fear fear everywhere. People who are afraid don't make rational choices. They don't reason or listen TO reason. You're all wrong. Britain will recover and when it does you'll be in your 'special place' holding your blanket and asking big 'Ol daddy Brtain for a handout. The people saying the young people's futures are ruined, are you fucking serious? You can't be......... The EU has done NOTHING to improve educational standards or help struggling students... Nothing. The EU doesn't care for little people, at all. It cares about power for powers sake. You have Junker calling for an EU army...........WTF people. Get a grip of yourselves. Panic panic panic.
1/0/0	You probably voted no in the first place, I don't think you want anything to work.
1/1	You ran the worlds biggest empire ... and now you are scared of leaving the EU
0/0	You realise that by having brexit they did an estimated £130bn of damage to the economy? (Until now, only to increase over time).
1/0	You really are ridiculous, look at youth unemployment figures in other EU countries, look at the Lisbon treaty, look at verhofstadt speeches, work it all out and then tell me you think by leaving you're taking away young people's futures.NO FOR BREXIT
0/0	You really kicked yourself in the teeth with this Brexit thing.
0/-1	You said Brexit was about patriotism, democracy & 'the will of the people' 'take back control'. I thought it was just about how much loot you lot could rake in, as your sister said. But it's REALLY to evade scrutiny of EU courts so you lot can grab power free from HoC or UK Laws.
0/0	You said it buster, just delay it long enough for the old and demented to give up the ghost and let the young people take us back in.
1/1	You said that the end that most people want to remain the ones who voted leave but I vote leave and I would vote leave again and again and again
0/0	You see? The problem in the UK is education: they don’t even teach you elementary punctuation rules…
1/0	You seem to want to be both out of the EU and in the EU at the same time. The head of the EU has said Britain needs to start the process of leaving now rather than later. The referendum was advisory? You mean the government can choose to ignore it? I don't think so. There are only a few thousand migrants in Calais? It's nice that you don't mind if they enter the U.K. I thought most voters who voted "out" did so to keep the migrants out, not to increase the amount that can get in. At least you admit people thought there were a lot more migrants trying to get in than there really were.
0/0	You stop paying your dues, but expect to continue to use the facilities for free.
1/0	You talk about the West, what West? Why not publish Michael Goves political indictment of this so called West. The West I know is the one in which the political franchise is in the hands of the people and not exercised by 33,000 unelected bureaucrats on a daily basis
0/1	You talk of dialogue, dialogue and more bloody dialogue, how long has the UK been in 'dialogue' with the monstrous leviathan that is the inept body EU?
0/0	You think #Remain is big? #Rejoin will be f*cking MASSIVE... because it will include ever-increasing numbers of former Leavers when they finally realise they were lied to.
0/0	You think it's bad now , wait until we actually leave! It's gonna be a bumpy ride
0/-1	You think you are so big you don’t need anybody.... it will be so beautiful to see you fall....
0/0/0	You think you have won. And take your day to gloat. But you have lost so much more than you know. We all have. And deep down, I think you know it too. Which is why for supposed "winners", so many of you are still so bitter and so angry. Rest assured, you have saddled your children and grandchildren with decades of rotten fallout to come; it is they who will shoulder the true burden of your reckless self-interest. Not you. What a petty, pointless, mean-spirited and spiteful legacy you leave behind. And what a thing to celebrate. RIP, UK - we fought for you. We really did. But billionare tax avoiders have won. For now.
1/1	You very deluded young lady if you think the EU is better you obviously don't love the UK that much bye bye sees you
1/1	You voted for me to help get #Brexit done & I've delivered on my promise. It's now time to unite & move forward together.
0/0	You voted in favour of it, now you all have to pay the price for your poor choices.
0/0	You wait and see who's life expectancy fall if brexit goes through and it will be down to all the stupid bastards who voted to leave. Oh yes, and you.
0/0	You were duped by Russian hacking and misinformation, too. It gave us a clown president and it took you out of the EU. We are and will forever be brothers.
0/-1	You were naive, as was anybody who thought an in/out referendum on the biggest political decision in our country's history was a good idea in any way, shape or form.
1/0	You whinging scrotes lost...there will NOT be another referendum. Go cry on mummys shoulder losers
1/1/-1	You will feel a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of remain voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
1/1	You will go bankrupt without the UK. Go recognise!
1/0	You will regret this.
0/1	You will see that, at best, we are going to get a soft brexit where we pay through our nose, lose all our influence and become the laughing stock of Europe.
0/0	You won't know what you've lost until it's gone, little Britain. The utter stupidity. The incoherent mindlessness.
0/0	You won. Get over it - and take responsibility for what you voted for.
0/0	You would think that a Government desperate to keep the UK together would be trying to increase its contact with the Scotland
1/1	You'd think after 4 years of losing, Remainers would give up by now and join the winning team hahaha.
0	You'll have no one to blame if Brexit fucks up, Brexiteers. You got what you wanted and you now have to live with it. Who am I kidding, they'll always blame someone other than themselves.
0/0	You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race.
0/-1	You'll still have your cup of tea, teddy bears, and the Queen.
0/0	You're all idiots! Being in the EU was better for us
0/0	You're never a loser until you quit.
0/0/0/0	You're right, people should unite, not devide
1/-1/1	You're the man Mr. Farage.
0	You've always been able to do that, but you cut them. Brexit will be a yoke around ALL our necks for the next 10 years. You will be constantly humiliated, begging cap in hand to try to retrieve just a portion of the many benefits we now have in our Germany +++ deal. #StopBrexit
1/1	You've been hearing about Brexit for 3 years. And it's still going. Wasn't there already a vote? Where does it stand and what comes next? What's a Hard Brexit? A 'no-deal' Brexit? What is the Irish backstop? If you don’t understand Brexit, here’s your chance to catch up.
0/0	You've been living in the wrong EU. You've inhabited the EU of the foetid mind of English Europhobes who consistently and resolutely refuse to open their eyes to the reality of the European Union. It's a pity because this blindness has wrecked Britain.
0/0	You've had 2 years to deliver "your brexit". You have failed to do so. Now it's time for people to decide whether or not to continue with this madness. No election - a second referendum. Then an election so that Corbyn can lead us into a new era of peace, prosperity and partnership with our European friends.
1/1	You've had over two years! All extra time does is play into the EU's hands. That is what they want - to delay, delay, delay. We voted to leave, deal or no deal.
0/0	You've just sold a key defence company to US asset strippers Advent. Its UK director said "even if Brexit were ultimately a good thing, it would create “significant challenges” and cause the UK to lose out on investment" He applied for Cypriot citizenship in 2018. #UKForSale
1/1	You've regained sovereignty!
0/0	Young people understand the impact of Brexit better.... #antibrexit
1/1	Youngsters will be called up to the new EU army. We're getting EU tax codes. Cameron has signed fast track for Turkey and Merkel gives them visa free travel. EU Commissioners says they're taking over all health services, so end of our NHS. We are subsidising bankrupt countries, high unemployment, uncontrolled migration, terrorism. The EU bank is in meltdown printing money like confetti. The EU project has failed and heading for extinction. We are Great Britain and can stand on our own feet. Love your kids future. Love Britain. VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Your PM is of the same nature as Trump. The UK will be in trouble in the next years. But you believed all these liars and voted to leave, now you'll pay the price.
1/1	Your all so lucky. I wish we have to leave the EU too
0/0	Your faith in Brexit working out would be touching if it wasn¿t based on stupidity and ignorance! Only when the pain of Brexit hits will you understand the scale of your idiocy! Even then you¿ll probably have delusions about reliving World War 2. Oooooo rationing!
1/1	Your having a laugh,the Eu will never change,the French and Germans will see to that,it suits them how it is.
1/1	Your map shows that Switzerland, a central European country, is NOT a member of the EU. It never has been. And are the Swiss people living in poverty, unable to trade with the countries around them ? Of course not. In fact Switzerland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world. So much for the NEED for a nation to be in the EU ...
1/1	Your mission next #Thursday is quite simple. #Vote for #democracy, vote for #sovereignty, #voteLeave! #BBC #SKY #ITV
0/0	Your question implies there was a point where it was a good idea... I have been strongly remain since the start.
0/-1	Your ‘democracy’ is mob rule, populism sustained by lies about the European Union, shabby theatrical Gestures, and the pretence of integrity.
0/-1	Youth turnout was 40% while the national average was 70. As usual, the younger voters didn't bother showing up. The under 25s have no one but themselves to blame. The more politically engaged generation won the day.
0/-1	You’re kidding right ? Did you not take any finance classes while earning you’re MBA !? Sovereignty for sovereignty sake is NOT a solution! This is emotional short-term thinking.
1/1	You’ve had long enough and nothing will change the hard decision that has to be made. Get on with it. Out 29/3/19.
0/1/0	You’ve just insulted a whole load of your customers. I very much doubt all them were Remainers
0/1	Yup Brexit was a great idea, thanks guys who fucked over our country I mean voted leave.
1/1	Yup get us out of this Union!
0/0	Yup, all that and more is written into the Political Declaration, and Boris signed it. A bad mistake, but are we surprised.
1/-1	Yup, leave the EU
1	Yup. Do not believe the leftists lies and Brussels.
0/0	Zero tariffs? Lol. Good luck.
0/-1	[Don't Do It](https://i.imgur.com/18BwYOI.jpg)
1/1/1	a 'coup' is an illegal take overBrexit was not. Although since then, we have been betrayed by the government...
0	a dark cloud has descended onto me and I swear the gloom is directly related to how I feel about Brexit, the increasing hatred seen on our streets and the direction the country is going in
0/0	a lot of "leave" voters already admitted to regretting their vote as it was more a protest vote and they didn't think about the consequences.
1/-1	a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer’s Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work
1/1	a shed load of new laws from the eu where waiting  till after the vote, thank nigel (god) we got out.
0/0	a stupid decision, made by stupid people, who had no idea what they were voting for
1/1	a) Thanks for asking for rational debate - I just got told I was being 'offensive' on r/unitedkingdom for wishing people 'were less explosive' and would actually engage with the debate rather than resorting to abusive rhetoric on both sides. (You can probably tell that rubbed me up the wrong way) b) The UK is the fifth strongest economy in the world - something pro-EU campaigners always pass over when saying leaving would destroy us economically. The EU can't feasibly halt all trade with the UK because that is not really how it works, and many many countries not in politically unified blocks survive economically. All the arguments have been made by other comments so check those out. c) My main reason in sovereignty. I dislike the necessity of only really expressing my democratic right by electing representatives because we only actually have vague guarantees on how they will conduct their role as a representative and their decisions are more about their views than it is about ours. With that in mind, the idea that MEPs can elect someone on my behalf is ridiculous because in reality I have absolutely no say. If only a huge minority of the population has any say in such elections, that is not democracy. d) I don't deny there won't be a negative consequence over leaving the EU, it is a very real possibility, mainly because uncertainty makes people nervous. In fact that seems to be the main point that pro-EU arguments make. BUT that doesn't mean leaving isnt the right decision. The unelected leaders of the EU/European Commission have said too much nervewracking things about undermining the sovereignty of members states (including removing the UK's seats on the UN, G7 ect in favour of integrating them into EU seats which gives us far less say in world affairs) to make me happy to remain in the EU. Fear of short term disruption, which will occur after any big change is not a satisfactory argument against long term change for the better, because that would mean we could never and would never change anything, and are slaves to the status quo and may as well not have democracy because making decisions is on the whole a bad idea.
1/1	absolutely no eu fishing in british waters.
1/-1	accelerate EU trade talks, maximise the advantage, take control.
0/-1	actually how could we live without fish and chips, or sausage sandwiches??
1/1/1/1/1	after the blip in our democracy in 1975 we are back on track as a free nation and democracy. now we need to fight against political correctness and get free speech back
0/-1	again the Government not listening to the citizens
1	all EU flags should be handed in and incinerated by the gov
0/0	all that austerity for nothing and the brexitanian cult is still desperate for its apocalypse
0/0	all this because white people would rather destroy their own nations than live next to people of color. Same thing happening in the United states
0/-1	all those regulations are there for a reason just like the US has a lot of regulations. And the UK were a part when deciding these laws. and if there was somethijng the didn't liked the could use a VETO what they also sometimes did (prove that they can VETO). Many are forgotten that the brexit vote came from Cameron who just wanted more EU laws in the UK's favour but he didn't want to exit and now look.
1/1	all you need to know is that the UK will be a better place to do anything and everything because the Brussels bureaucracy will no longer hold sway in this country . Amen .
1/-1	allow for greater controll with trade with the rest of the world
0/1	alot of the reasons people voted to leave were reasons of passion. Not economical reasons entirely that can be simply explained.
1/1	already done people voted together out f EU dictatorship
0/0	already gone and never going back, the wonderful world of the EU countries has a level of peace happiness prosperity and civilisation that sadly the UK will never have again in my lifetime
1/1	am English & voted with many of my friends family & people from the same street to LEAVE the EU. We simply do not think it is a good idea to be ruled by a foreign power that does not have our best interests in mind & would like to control our borders. This is a very small country that is nearly full. This man is a liar & a fool. We are not racists - in fact as a country we are remarkably tolerant. We realised that to leave may make us poorer but felt that this was a cost worth paying.
1/1	am from London and i dont think people in the North of England are racist all of us that voted to leave done the right thing. because if we didn vote leave imagine how overpopulated an unrecognisable this country will be in maybe 20 30 40 or 50 years if we stay in the E.U this country will not look likr England no more and it will never be again
0/0	an people in their 60s stop saying We'll just take the hit" on Brexit. YOU WON'T BE THE ONES TAKING THE HIT. Your careers are either already established or finished. Some of us are are trying to get started. Some of us will have to support families in Brexit economy!"
0/0	and higher prices, int'l marginalisation, recession... Whoops!
1/1	and staying in will see us bled by EU commissars
1/1	and the there's people crying into lit candles, speaking about it being a grieving process? it feels like her europeaness has been taken away haha. no it's your brains what's been taken away love.
1/1	and yes this great country of united kingdom have helped to liberate europe twice ,so we know only to well what freedom means.
1/1	and you wont get our money , then watch your glorious united states of europe fall apart , under monetary pressure . prick .
0/0	and, as per usual, Conservatives can break anything, but have absolutely no idea how to fix anything...
1/1	another panel of ""so-called-experts"" every time that remoaners try and demonise Brexit or the Brexit negotiations or put Boris down they always claim its by a ""panel of experts"" and mostly its just ""one person's opinion"" one self important up their own ares's personal opinion, and rarely has anything to back it up with, just words and opinions ""nothing else"" and they're so arrogant that they think everyone should listen to them and hang on every word ""but people are not that stupid""
0/0	any political leader who speakes about UK leavindg the European Union ,is in fact an enemy of the democracy and freedom.
0/-1	anyone else wondering why our journalists and mainstream media didn't provide this and further in depth debate and analysis before the vote in 2016? looking back, there was such a lack of real factual debate hence the 300 mil nhs slogan. People voted to leave, but did they do so with a real knowledge of the impact on trade, customs checks, good Friday agreement and other issues ?
0/0	anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it’s wrong.  Stop Brexit
1/1	as a British person watching this video, it's very biased against the Brexit position. Brexit is about Democracy and support for Brexit is as Strong as ever.
1/1	as a remain voter i was saddened. but a year later. im now glad the leave vote won. And glad to give the EU the middle finger.
0/0/0/0/0	as an American I will say it's a huge mistake to leave EU.
0/0	as an asian looking at this 'brexit' from far away, it will not be an 'apocalypse'...but it will certainly bring lots of damage to uk...i think many british people still have too much pride from their 'empire' days...the truth is uk were strong whenever they were either in a war with another country or had colonies...i'm not an economy expert or a politics expert..but this whole 'brexit' thing came out of stupid ignorance
0/0/0	as crazy as it sounds i think british still haven't anderstood anything to the brexit.
1/1	as i Brexiteer i can tell you the people who voted leave would rather live in a river than be governed by the EU.who would want to be associated with a dangerous,desperate ideology like the EU
1/1	ask the EU nothing tell them what needs to happen and that they have 1 week to make up their minds if not we leave no deal and you loose 39 billion simple
1/1	at the very least.... the British people are back in charge of their own future, and will prove the "People" are once again correct.
0/0	aww poor little victim Brexiter pensioners..... afraid of Islam,afraid of the EU... just retreating into a little England comfort bubble of Daily Mail hate, whispers and vitriol. Come on guys, seriously? what have you become? Peace and Love.

0/0	i can see how in 20 years england will blame EU for their economical situation, "they boycotted our economy because we dared to free ourselves from them" it is never going to be their fault,we will become the monsters in their mythology... -_- the EU is not going to make you suffer for leaving,that will just be the effect of losing privileges
1/1	i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.

1/1	i love brexit i voted out
0/-1	i love his over reaction and disbelief every time someone tells him they will continue to vote for Brexit. Such disdain like they are stupid. The North have been dumped on for years and staying in the EU will only see more British money pumped into Europe and building a terrifying EU Army and not money and a future into OUR northern cities. I'm glad the journalist made the effort to see the troubles for himself, next stop should be Rotherham and then Luton. It wont change his mind but I would love to hear what new phrase to describe this situation will be from the leftist think tank. Displacement activity. Lol
1/1	i must be an exception because im 17 and although i cant vote if i could i would have voted leave

0/1	i voted remain but the past 3 and a half year were torture waiting it was the will of the people and i just wanted us to move on
1/1	i voted to leave because; when we had our mp expenses scandal one mp said"thinkyourself lucky your not bliving in europe its a hundred times worse there, recently a study on corruption within the eu claim 144 billion gone in corruption with a total cost of 800 billion, i didnt want to pay for our own corruption let alone the likes of bulgaria,croatia, greece and italy
1/1	i was never asked if i wanted to be irrevocably bound by laws set by an unelected commission
0/0	i'm american, but from an outside standpoint, i like the eu. it just seems like a good idea-the countries are stronger together, and it means that the only wars in europe are from other continents. in fact, i think we should have something like that with canada and mexico! it would probably help to solve a lot of economic problems, especially in mexico, it would fix the illegal immigration issue, and it would ensure that the hostility trump sparked with mexico didn't turn into actual fighting.
0/-1	i'm glad I left little Britain to live in the Netherlands...A the people are so polite here and B the country is a damn sight lot cleaner too
0/0/0	i'm just getting drunk until well in the morning then see what shit looks like tomorrow, probably still be the same but somehow tomorrow lost, the real storm will happen at the end of the year for brexit to take affect, well what a stupid country we have now

0/0	i, like many my age, votes ‘remain’ it was (in the majority) the older generations who most likely won’t see the impact whom voted ‘leave’
0/-1	id prefer it if the vote was based on fact, reason and logic. Not lies and hatred.
0/1	if Brexiters don't like being called thick, maybe they should quit producing this kind of weapons grade idiocy. #BrexitCelebration
0	if anyone leaves it will end with war I just know it
1/1	if brexit vote by the public does not count then each time people vote for a new government then that vote does not count so let's just have a dictatorship
1/1	if everyone wants to know why Britain left the EU watch the movie that was made about which you can find free of charge on youtube. the name of the movie is Brexit. it is very informative and explains everything for Britain's perspective.
1/1	if it wasnt for Britain you would be writing this in German and not Spanish! ..... good luck fishing and enjoy your precious EU toilet hole.... your welcome to it!
1/1	if the Lisbon treaty isn't a good enough reason for us to leave the eu then i don't know what is
0/0	if the UK leaves the EU, its gonna be a disaster for the British citizens, Economic crisis for the whole Uk
1/1	if the majority are supposed to be pro-EU how come we have so many Anti-EU MEP's?
1/1	if the votr was tomorrow i would vote to leave, we are strong enough, and why shoukd we let brussels tell us what to do , thats why we fought 2 world wars, to stay a free nation , to control our own destiny, and our own borders, VOTE YES i will.

0/1	if u believe that migrants are simultaneously taking all our jobs AND sponging off the benefits system then you're a daft'un.
1/1	if we fail due to sanctions it will be blamed on brexit and used as a pretext to justify the EU's existence.
0/0	if we leave nothing will change, we will have to follow the same laws to trade with them
1/0	if we leave we get blessed by god if we stay we get judged by god dont mess with gods land
0/-1	if we left and got Labour we'd quite honestly be totally and completely screwed!!! That is because in order to make leaving work we have to become a competitive country.
0/0/0	if you are rich & can move assets it's bonanza time. The other 99% of the population are screwed
0/0	if you really want a poorer and more irrelevant britain, then brexit is a good way to go.
0/0	if you travel to Spain, Italy, Holland, France you'll be amazed of their agriculture power. UK sliced it's throat

0/-1	immigration to live or work
0/-1	immigration, the area over which many Eurosceptics most long for control.Exactly, by leaving the EU, Britain can stop the migrants
1/1	in France a lot of French people admire the choice that anglettere made with brexit.
1/1	in the EU we might be able to..., we could perhaps..., it may be possible to... Rubbish! It has never been possible - they only want our money, not our naturally conservative outlook. The show is run by Germany and to a lesser extent France and that is it. The EU is drivng away from what was a sensible economic co-operation model - the free market we voted to join, into a political project whose ultimate goal will be a federal EU, where member state parliaments are redundant and all decisions are made by people who are unaccountable. If we are forceed by the Remainers to stay in, it will be the Euro next and the EU Army, then taxes, the whole process will be accelerated as the EU hierarchy will feel they have an open door to do what they like. A significant reason why many voted Brexit in the UK was I'm sure to retain our fundamental rights of self-detemrination/sovereignty. And if the peoples of EU member states were allowed to vote, I have no doubt many of the nation states would vote the same way. France included.
0/0	in the UK we currently enjoy the largest choice of products globally than any other country this maximises the end value to GDP contributions .Brexit will annihilate this. Soon we will only have Paprika flavoured crisps to choose from !!
1/1	in the end the majority voted to leave, so I think we should leave.

0/0/0	is my message to britan you are one of our most powerful members but if you leave we will maybe become much more powerless and maybe disolve so if you stay the eu will be more powerful so please stay
1/0/1	is the french man upset because he cant gang up on us anymore
1/1	isn't EU part of the UN , globalist control ???? I think UK should be independent , as before ,
0/0	it has been kind of exhilarating to watch Britain partly realizing how incredibly dangerous and detrimental Brexit is going to be
1/1	it is a very, very significant break and it plays into the president’s view that the world should be nations, free-market democracies and not globalist bureaucracies
1/1/1	it is apparent that the eu wants to be much more than a trading bloc and that isn't what we voted to join
0/0	it is at best pointless and fantastically expensive, and at worst disastrous for Britain politically, economically and socially.
0/0	it is good to have Britain in the EU to counterbalance Germany and France. Besides it will cost my country a lot of money and economic damage when Britain leaves.
0/-1	it is invalid . period .
0/0	it is not EU going down idiot , it is UK ..u must be blind not to see it
0/0	it is up to the government to act responsibly and find a way to cancel Brexit. The vote was a result of ingnorant people being told lies by Farage Boris and the like and believing them. The farmers are a prime example. The NHS will be even worse off. and and .
0/0	it is with grief and regret that I accept that we will leave the European Union on Friday. Oh no, here come the tears,
0/0	it leads to mass unemployment.
1/1	it means more patriotism, it means steps away from a dangerous NWO and the Bilderberg group. It means less rape in Britain. Nothing is going to happen to the EU migrants anyway.
0/0	it seems like a massive screw-up from the politicians. You can blame the voters a bit too, but really, this should never have gone to a vote.
0/0	it sounds like a mess that they're going along with anyway because of the "sunk cost" thing. Really dumb.
0/0/0	it sounds very stupid to leave the eu
0/0	it turns out they are all batshit crazy. But it's funny how Scotland and Ireland voted against leaving. So you know whtat that means? Good bye UK
1/1	it was the best idea ever, Britain has never been as united as now.
1/1	it will be THE first to leave the e.u. but I bet it won't be THE last
0/0	it will tear up international arrangements for trade, flow of capital and ease of travel and require endless fresh negotiations to re-establish anything like the access we have now.
0/-1	it would be an absolute disaster
1/1	it would be difficult to consider Britain a democracy if the free and valid Brexit election was ignored or overturned. that's banana republic stuff.
1/1	it's a clear choice between the short term economy and self-rule with belief in self-potential.
1/1	it's about time the UK gets there independence

0	it's not democracy when the majority of people that voted don't understand what they voted for.
1/1	it's not nationalism, fascism, racism or isolationism! It's democracy. The majority of British people voted to leave the European Union and their voices will be respected.
1/1	it's our country we need to sort us out PRIORITY.
1	it's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship !
1/1/0/1/1/1	it's such a beautiful thing seeing the UK do what is right. they at least give their country a chance
1/-1	italy will follow UK soon !
1/1	its about taking back our country and making our own laws, not by some unelected unaccountable idiot from Brussels that was not voted for by any of us
1/1	its amazing how someone can say so much and say nothing at all, LEAVE MEANS LEAVE!
0/0/0	its bad for their national economy and will have socio-economic effects on european union, as a Turkish person i think this is an opportunity for us to get closer with EU but probably not gonna happen with current political leaders
1/1	its becuaes i want my countries identity back, I don't want to be controlled by some un elected muppet in Brussels.
1/1	its easy. just go to a no deal
0/0	its so funny and nuts and crazy and stupid that some people really think the uk got the upper hand .funny times
0/0/0/0/0	it’s almost funny now we see all these videos explaining what brexit will mean AFTER the referendum. almost like no one really knew what they were voting for and believed the side of a bus....
0/0	it’s easy to get lost in the labyrinth of the divorce process and lose sight of just how bad an idea Brexit is. It’s bad for the economy, the young and the unity of the UK.
0/-1	it’s gonna be so hard to make brexit jokes now that it actually happened

1/1	last week I was shopping and I saw a guy walking around with a blue jumper with yellow stars on it. I approached him and asked if he was British? and he said 'yes'. I said 'why are you wearing that shit EU flag? If you want to wear a jumper why not wear a Union Jack one? Don't you support your country'? I took my coat off and dropped it on the floor along with my shopping bags. He took his jumper off and said he was sorry. I think he realised he was 30 seconds away from getting his lights knocked out. As he walked away, I heard his wife say to him 'See, I told you not to wear that stupid thing'.

1/-1	mindful of everybody’s feelings
1/-1	more distractions - Brexit is under way - the more important threat in the UK is the muslim invasion on the street and in the classroom.
0/0	more old white guys with an agenda. The UK is screwed, if you think it's bad now, you have no clue. It's about to get far worse. Next time Scotland has the chance it will go independent and go back to the EU
0/0/0	most Brits are pretty stupid after all they have a crack head for Chancellor so they will vote yes to out and yes to 3 million jobs going they can always fall back on blaming immigrants for everything when it all goes tits up
0/-1	most effective quote I've seen is, get ready to swap out white immigrants for brown immigrants
0/0	most inmigrants to UK are from Commomwealth of nations, not from middle east syrians. If European immigration policies are issued on Islamization of Britain it is a mistake, al Pakistan inmigrants to uk arrived thanks to Commonwealth not to EU.
1/1/1	most of the other EU countries apart from UK don't even follow the rules and regulations of the EU anyway, even more reason to leave when we are getting so spanked by rules and regs that others don't even follow
0/0	most of the ppl that voted "Leave" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision
1/1	most of us just want Brexit to be implemented and to get it done, and try our best to make it a success.
0/0	move all the headquarters out of there, create high taxes for any trades and make their lives impossible so no other country wants to leave.

1/-1	muh sovereignty
1/1	must say, I feel immensely proud. To all those ( that’s you ) for digging in. Putting up with constant vitriolic attacks from the ‘left’. We stood firm, kept going, we achieved our aim. #brexit achieved against all attempts to thwart democracy. I applaud you all
0/0	my assessment is Brexit is unlikely to deliver any economic gains
1/1	my biggest problem with the eu is that its increasingly becoming more of a superstate backed by elitists such as the rothchilds and soros just take a look at the eu army take a look at all the times we tried to block a deal and failed to do so
1/1	my elders told me they voted in to the EU. these are the same people who voted out in the masses just many years later. millennials blame the elders, but yet these elders are the ones with the best reason to do so for living through it
0/0/0	my friends in Europe don’t make the stupid mistakes we made.
0/0	my main problem is I don't trust the government. the eu helps take some power away from them, keeps the European human rights courts for us to go to and provides your average citizen with some recourse. we won't hate that without the eu. do you trust the government enough? I mean right now we had an education minister who didn't listen to headteachers, an environment minister who doesn't believe in climate change this isn't exactly a trust worthy government and i doubt those that follow will be much better.
0/0	my problem is I have no faith in my compatriots to be willing to listen to long version of what the issues are
1/1	nationalism is the only future. globalism is an anchor to hell.
1/0	next 15 years, 90% of world demand will be generated outside Europe. Yet the EU does not have free trade
1/1/1	next should be a swexit
0/0	nice move uk, you played yourself. now we sit back and watch their economy fall
0/0	no deal is looking more and more beautiful 30% tariffs on everything from Europe
1/1	no deal is the best deal! we voted leave we need to LEAVE. what may has agreed to is eternal servitude. britons never never never shall be slaves.
1/1	no deal, good for farmers, butchers, local shops, community everyone
1/1	no delay I want out asap we have waited long enough for these overpaid penpushers to do their job!
0/0	no it isn't. Brexshit is like the sense of freedom you get absailing for the fist time without the support of a rope. For some reason I have never met anyone keen to try it twice...
1/1	no more illegal EU backed regime change that resulted in the migrant crises. People died and lost their homes. Now UK will not participate in war crimes. Mass migration will not be necessary as people will have their homes.
0/-1	no natural resources, no industry and no more colonies to exploit its devinatively byebye little Britain!!
1/-1	no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition, subsidies, social protection
1/1	no one is worthy of leading all so no one should lead all. the brexit is progress for humanity. the eu is progress for certain segments of society. I choose humanity over society, you can keep your economic lies.
1/1	no pain no gain
0/0	no respect any more for the uk none whatsoever!
0/0	no we wait for a fast secession between Scotland, ireland and north ireland , gibraltar included. Britain will be isolated soon and will lost 90% of companies and commerce with eu zone

1/1	nobody cares lol
1/1	nobody in their right mind would believe we are about to start deporting people who live here
1/1	none have impacted me directly, its more the impact on my society for example the EU common fisheries policy has severy damaged my countries fishing industry, the free movement of labour has also severly impacted the job and housing markets in my country making it harder to get employment that pays well and making it harder to get a house,
1/1	not forgetting every doom and gloom story that has come out since brexit started hasn't come true I find it very difficult to believe what they're going to come out with
1/1	not from england and i support england and agree for that move ..david comeron you are possy you should stand for your country mf and respect the england desire
0/0	not often we get to watch a country like Britain burn itself to the ground.
1/1	now I would vote in favour of Brexit. The reason is the way the EU has been so difficult in offering a beneficial deal to the UK on trade. I am a big free trader and I believe that there should be no restrictions on trade.
0/0	now is not the time to campaign to rejoin, but we must keep the dream alive, especially for young people, who are overwhelmingly #proEuropean,"
1/1	now let the exodus begin
1/1	now merkel controls every aspect of british lives. so what was ww2 all about? vote leave, and make britain great again. canada and australia are doing a lot better than greece and spain.

1/1	one of the Greatest days of my life
0/0	one of the most shocking and depressing days of my life
0/0	one of the reasons I personally dislike it because it gives more power to our government; we have no constitution, Parliment can pass and repeal whatever they want. Between this, Theresa May's reclusiveness and the Home Secretary's attempts expand surveillance, I'm worried this country is moving into a more authoritarian direction.

0/1/0	poor england and wales, that you had to believe the lies of politicians and tabloids!
0/-1	post Brexit I will have precisely the same control as I do now, possibly less
0/0	potential benefits of brexit: none.
1/1	probably more the latter since alot of the laws are pretty minor (although for the economy needless bureaucracy can be really bad for minor buisnesses making it easy for large corps to crush small competition) but having a superior power makes my vote mean less and their are laws as i said my country cant change directly. not only that the EU is getting more and more centralised to the point where it wants to become a federal state much like the US or Germany i dont want to be in a nation with Europe we have conflicting goals values and principles and i am concerned because of the structure of the EU (the people who initiate votes for laws or the removal of laws arent elected by the people) the whole of europe could fall under a tyranical state.

1/1	remoaners have been crushed so far
0/0	respondents noted that even if a disorderly Brexit was averted, uncertainty over the UK’s future trading relations will limit the potential for a rebound, with the UK unlikely to return to pre-referendum levels of growth or to perform as well as its main trading partners.
0/0	rexit makes me so sad
0/0	sadly, the people will still prefer to hear the comforting lie over the uncomfortable truth. The UK becomes less important by the day

0/0	sn't it mad that we are literally living in a geographical and historical case study
1/0	so britain can get a vote leave the EU, which evidently has turned out for the worst, but America cant even get a vote to ban guns
0/1	so for the next 3 years we are going to be paying billions into the eu, for absolutely nothing. an immediate NO DEAL would have been better.
0/-1	so now brits threaten the EU

0/0	so scotland wants to be independent and then join the EU
0/-1	so scotland wants to be independent and then join the EU.....

0/1	so you'd buy some gas, internet and car insurance on a permanent fixed contract for the rest of your life ?
1/1	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !
1/1	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !! 😨
0/0	some leavers don't like facts i see. Let's be honest, the only plausible reason to leave the EU is because of the undemocratic way the EU operate, but at the same time has immigration been that much of an issue on the whole? Are foreigners to blame for all our problems? and did anyone on the leave side expect it to be a case of 'just leave, it'll be easy'. No. At the cost of our economy crashing, many innocents jobs in jeopardy, and the poorest and most vulnerable people being badly affected. All that doesn't matter i guess, so long as we leave the EU?
0/0	some of the British still think that United Kingdom is still half the world sorry to tell u its only a dot on the map now and it hardly has anything to offer anyone in the world because we ain't the world anymore...
1/1	sooner or later the EU bean counters are going to wonder from where they are going to find the billions that Blighty no longer pays into their Empire..............Germany and France will have to fill the gap as some of the other economies in their glorious Empire are tanking or on the brink
0/0	sorry we haven't left yet. I think we should trust all the economic experts who know more about this than any of us. we will be worse off as a result of leaving. there is no evidence to suggest we will be better off. we shouldn't have left

1/1	surprising how Remainers call a non binding amendment a democratic vote and go on about referendum of 2016 being advisory .these people flip flop more than corybn
1/-1	t must be painful for the BBC to admit.
1/1	t was a close run thing, no thanks to the Scots who now should leave the Union if they love the EU so dearly, As for Wales, shoulder to shoulder we stood on the day - Victory is ours!
0/0	t will mean having to go through customs, like before. New trade agreements, new taxes, new limitations. New security. And a lot more costs to do so.
1/1	t's a judgement call. Are you a lion who leads or a sheep who follows?
0/1	t's interesting to see all those brave Brexiteers frothing at the mouth....
0/0	t's sad what xenophobia did to the UK! The British people decided to lose their economy and social welfare to get rid of foreigners (This is what Brexit actually rmeans). This is Fascism!

1/0/1	the EU don't want a deal it's clear to see no matter what we propose the EU will block it it's all about land and the 39billon the dictatorship will not agree to eneything
1/1	the EU has become a straight up crime against the people of europe.
1/1	the EU has demonstrated that leaving the EU not possible without being bullied and harrassed into greeing to still be tied to the EU. Effectively staying in the EU.
1/0	the EU is a supranational, democratically subversive, federalist institution, that cares nought for the least advantaged, and is leading Europe by the nose to a high-tech, feudalist future, as a first step to a globalist NWO.
1/1	the EU is also the slowest growing economy well other than Antarctica...

1/0	the EU membership is our biggest problem
1/0	the EU needs us
1/-1	the EU places high legal/economical restrictions on trade (goods have to be of specific quality)
1/1	the EU stinks
0/0	the EU suffocates sovereignty and freedom? How backwards. I've lived in 3 different EU countries in my life, I feel free and I do not feel attached to one state only. There are European elections btw for those who say they do not have a right to vote. It's not right to criticise sitting on your arse at home when no one does his homework to find out about the rights given to him. Anyway, it is done. Do not come back crying.
1/1	the EU, my government have ignored its own citizens for decades since joining. They have become fat and lazy because the EU makes most of the rules now
0/-1	the French politicians are idiots to tell Britain that Calais jungle would move to Britain in case of Brexit, there's no forceful law that says that even in the case of no Brexit Calais jungle should remain in France

If asked to expand, we will ensure that we will have the right to regulate and are not constrained by EU law or the court of justice of the European Union
1/1	the best thing that our country has done yet
1/1	the best thing will be to get out of EU. the filthy propaganda of better in are all lies. u.k will be finished if it stays in. E.U is colapsing anyway

0/0	the cost of Brexit equal the "savings" in contribution to the EU. Anyway the world economy as a system loses because there is no contribution to the EU and the UK economy is smaller. Everyone lose out.
1/1/1	the costs of being in eu are not worth it
0/-1	the country which colonised the entire world is fearing immigration what an irony

1/1	the germans have finally taken all other countries in europe under their control without a shot being fired.
0	the goal should be one global union, brexit is a huge step back ... everybody involved will suffer...
1/1	the goverment should hurry up and get on with brexit go we can get on mking great briton again!.
1	the idea is that Britain will be more free and accountable
0/0	the main mood of people is to stay in the EU. Their blinkered view will destroy the union as Scotland and Wales will leave, to remain. Those living in the past will get a massive shock, there will be anger,
0/0	the momentum for staging a fresh independence referendum
1/0	the money we spend is nothing compared to the loss of opportunities.
1/1	the more foreigners that leave the better.
1/1	the nation will come out of it stronger, with new purpose, a renewed identity and ready to compete in the fast evolving 21st century.
0/0	the only good thing about Brexit is that it will herald the end of the Tory party
0/1	the only ones who want to stay are greedy selfish business people and liberals who jobs and work have not been effected yet by mass imigration
1	the only people moaning about brexit are the remainers who havnt gotton thier own way. keep throwing youre teddy out of it cot... yall pathetic
0/1	the only thing i actually like about brexit is the blue passport

1/1	the people voted out, they never voted in.
0/0	the pissing contest of migrants and non-migrants is false. The owners of business drive this trend. They don't care where you were born, they want to fuck the workers over for profit. we don't want these kind of people in business. Once they're squeezed out, it's remarkable how working for a decent boss/company changes your outlook on the world.
1/1	the plan is: 1) Pretend a decent deal is impossible, (it isn't.) 2) Pretend that no deal is worse than a plague of boils. (it isn't.) and therefore, 3) Insist we have to stay in. (We don't want to.) The EU must think we're stupid if they expect us to swallow that nonsense. WTO in March is now the best deal. Then perhaps talk after the money tap is turned off.
0/-1	the pound plummeted immediately after the result

1/0	the rational for Europe used to be PEACE but it is no longer, now the rational for Europe is POWER
1/1	the reason I voted to leave what I call the EU(SSR) is because I see it surging towards a Globalist Super State, very nice for the wealthy political elite but not for the 'ordinary' citizen who's main function would be to pay for it
1/1	the remain campaign literally has only even given hypothetical scare stories, they never bring up any positive benefits of being in it, I can't even list a good reason to stay

0/0	the sun backs the leave campaign and you should know to always do the opposite of what the sun tells you #voteremain
1/1	the supranational centralisation of power undermines British democracy
0/0	the symbol of huge collapse
1/0	the thing that MEPs are realy angry about is the loss of the EU gravy train. £150,000 a year salary, + expenses + plus the index Linked pension , early retirement and all the blind respect that goes with it and the POWER! oh and the chauffeur driven cars and the endless social functions and parties, believing that they are Europes political political elite!

As for no room left did you know that more land in the UK is allocated to Golf courses than for House Building.
0/0	the voters were deceived by lies into voting for Brexit, but the government doesn't see why they should have a revote with the lies exposed and the thousands signing the petition for a second vote, because apparently the people can't change their minds now the truth has been brought to light
1/1	the way he's talking he could be one of the best PM we have ever had.
0/0/0	the woman is in denial... she says the UK has had advantages as a member of the EU, so how can she think those advantages will remain when it is no longer in the EU??? this is the kind of thinking she and her think tank comes out with??? i for one think that Airbus will slowly move its factory to the EU...
0/0	the worst decision made by UK in a long, long time
0/0	the worst-case scenario—no future trade deal with the EU, no transition period at the end of March 2019, and a loss of trade agreements with non-EU countries—GDP would fall by more than 10%.
1/0	their are a large number of laws that i have to follow that where not implemented by my parliament or by one of my elected represetatives laws me and my countrymen cant change because it requires the votes of people from other nations.
1/1	their are a large number of laws that i have to follow that where not implemented by my parliament or by one of my elected represetatives laws me and my countrymen cant change because it requires the votes of people from other nations. i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.

0/-1	there will be a deal,and everyone is going to hate it.
1/1	there's a lot of spin out there, it's difficult to sift through. I'm not worried about leaving... The EU is falling apart and we're on the edge of a world reccession. Better to get a head start.

0/0	think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything.
1/1	think we can allow ourselves a couple of days to feel triumphant. After that, back to work with a vengeance, knowing we are working for ourselves. As for the bill for £1.9 billion, marked 2019-2020, surely we only need to pay a twelfth of that? We aren't going to be there for the other eleven months, we don't pay rent on an empty house?
0/0	this brexit thing is totally a mess – what a disaster for both parties!

0/0	this is so said... and I truly hope that our kids can fix it again what we have missed to address properly. We should quickly allow to define a mode of working together with focus on the youth and future generations. The challenge is not a border or the EU, the challenge is how do we all survive facing radical environmental changes. I love the spirit of the EU and I love the UK.

0/0	unfortunately people in the UK know a little about history and economy.

I can't wait to see those British retards pushing UK's economy them self...can't wait
1/1	unions need the membership money from all the EU workers, also are we that incapable of implementing our own laws
1/1	united Europe is not a dream, its a nightmare. if Europe stays together it will eventually become like the United states, where all states become second to a federal government, that does what the huge corporations want and the states will eventually start to deteriorate, that is what is happening in the USA.In the USA the 1% of the rich now have 40% of all the wealth, while the remaining 99% have 60%, that is an increase of about 120% for the rich, in about the last 20 or so years, and that is steadily becoming more out of balance. When the rich can easily manipulate the population, through bought politics, it isn't going to benefit anyone but them, that is why the rich are working to unite the world, so that they can easily manipulate it.

0/0	ust forget about brexit. Most of us want to stay but the stupid UK government is blindly determined to drive us all off a cliff to honour an old decision by an ill-informed public that should never have been theirs to make in the first place.
1/1	ust to clarify my perspective, some of you have interpretted my comment and come to the conclusion that the reason i wanted to leave the EU was so that we could become some deregulated wild west, where my actual belief is that the people who are most capable of putting in place effective legislation in the UK is the UK government,t

1/1	you forgot that eu is ruled by people NOT elected by citizens of eu and they still have the power to rule and change laws. The countries in eu loses their democracy. EU is a dictatorship
0/0	you forgot to mention that the brexit will reduce the freedom of movement, defence and do business with the excuse of liberty.
0/0	you forgot to mention that the brexit will reduce the freedom of movement, defence and do business with the excuse of liberty. And that brexit will move the power from an all-elected Brussel (where Farange could get a salary) to a monarchy with litterally lords by using the slogan: take back control from unelected burocrats.... They said that to finance the NHS, you need to give up internationally financed cancer research programs..
1/1	you must be a fool if you believe that left wing propaganda, I new the facts, voted to leave.
0/0	you need immigrants because you didnt make babies but want your pension. someone has to do the work, because you dont want to go back working on the farms. now after leaving the eu, make a legislation that lets employed immigrants stay and unemployed have to go home. problem solved
1/1	you sir are a fucking idiot! If you dont like the outcome of the vote id pack up and emigrate :)
0/0	you will go down like the titanic
0/0	you will wake up soon an realise, you’ve made a massive mistake. Trust me. It’ll take some time but you’ll come around
0/0	£40 billion divorce bill, open borders, Eu regulations, annual payment for customs union.. yay, finally we're nearly out! Not quite the Utopia Farridge and BJ sold everyone.. let's stop this complete waste of time and money, stay in the EU where we at least have a say in what goes on, and get on with our lives which were perfectly fine before Cameron started all this nonsense!
1/1	‘Delaying or cancelling Brexit would be a "calamitous" breach of trust with the electorate’ The death of democracy? 1 vote, 1 result – the majority who turned out voted Leave Make sure we do.
0/1	‘We won, you lost, get over it’ they tell me. But nobody can tell me what they ‘won’ in tangible non-soundbite terms. How their families will not be actually worse off with Brexit. Get over it? No. I care for this country. Now we can begin the #Rejoin process!
1/0	‘at less we will now be exploited by real British politicians and not EU one’
1/1	’Soft-Brexit’ is simply ’Not-Brexit’, an attempt to undo, as much as possible, the referendum result and keep us as close to the status-quo as possible.
1/1	’m a 23-year-old nursing student. We have a chance to take this country in a progressive direction. Leaving the EU does not mean we have to become a rightwing reactionary country. British values are what the people want them to be. I think that all Brits will unite against the racist rhetoric that has dominated this referendum. I think they will deny Boris, Farage or even Osborne the chance to become prime minister as they know they can’t be trusted to lead a post-Brexit Britain. We have to stand up, shout and protest for a general election. If this is a new era for Britain, the British public should have the chance to decide what direction we take.
0	“Applicants must have the unrestricted right to live and work in the EU.” British only nationality not good enough.
1/-1	“Brexit preparation will be a competitive differentiator. Those who have failed to prepare will find it harder to attract investor support, recruit staff, find the right warehousing or meet customer expectations over the long term.”
1/-1	“Ducks don’t go with swans” says the woman next to me, on the subject of interracial relationships. The racism on parliament square at the moment sickens me. Completely appalled #BrexitDay #BrexitCelebration
1/0	“End of the world” according to remoaners!.
0/0/0	“Great national drama” really says a lot about the worldview of the upper class Tory politicians. It’s all a fun game to them.
1/1	“How Britain lost Europe”? Britain didn’t “lose” Europe. Britain VOTED to leave it. No wonder ppl hate the media and call it fake news. It doesn’t represent what voters want, it represents what the elites want.
0/0	“I have a cunning plan” declares novice sailor Baldrick, aka @BorisJohnson as he signs the log book and takes the good ship HMS Blighty out into the north Atlantic, searching for an iceberg.
0/0	“New things to come” Coronavirus has entered the chat.
0/0	“Stop whinging and accept what’s happening!” say Brexiters who spent 47 years whinging and not acccepting what’s happened.
0/1/1/1	“The EU is enormously powerful.” This is exactly why you leave if you value sovereignty.
1/1	“The majority believe that Brexit is more important, and would back Brexit even if this led to the future breakup of the UK”.”
0/-1	“Until this moment, Johnson’s life and career have been a kind of monument to wishful thinking
1/1	“We just want to be out of the EU because that’s what people voted for”
1/1/0	“We want a thriving trade and economic relationship with the EU. So long as it's under our rules and not theirs.
0/0	“don’t fix something that isn’t broken”
0/0	“leaving the EU” is a mistake for certain and first and foremost in how it is being executed. This way it cannot be but a failure.
1/1	“we have made our choice”
1/1	”Fake news! UK will prosper as soon as Bojo signes that fantastic America first trade deal.”
0/1	† I know exactly how it will end. †
1/1	🇬🇧 Hard Brexit all the way 🇬🇧
0/0	😆 it's funny, when the brits sees the raise in taxes for the commercial negotiations they will want to be back to EU or begin piracy endeavours as they always did before the ww2. they feel really "independent" but the only reason they did this is because papa USA allow this.
0/0	🤣🤣 imagine that bulgarian and romanian passport will be better than british passport 🤭🤭
